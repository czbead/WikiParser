He was a monarch from birth as his father, [[Alfonso XII]], had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.  During Alfonso's reign of the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], the country experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the [[Rif War]]; and [[Catalan nationalism]]. The political and social turbulence that began with the [[Spanish–American War]] prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true [[liberal democracy]], which led to the establishment of the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera|dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.  He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy.  Alfonso was nicknamed \"the Royal Knight of Charity\" for his unprecedented work with the [[European War Office]] during [[World War I]].<ref>[https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/2018/01/royal-knight-of-charity-king-alfonso-xiii-of-spain-in-wwi/ Anchi Hoh, \"“Royal Knight of Charity”: King Alfonso XIII of Spain in WWI\" in ''Library of Congress'', Jan., 2018]</ref> For this great humanitarian endeavour, he was nominated to the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1917, and came close to receiving the award, but this was ultimately won by the [[Red Cross]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=687 Nomination Archive.

He was the posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain|Spanish prime minister]] [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta|Práxedes Mateo]] on a silver tray.  Five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the [[River Jordan]] in Israel.<ref>''Magnificent Monarchs'' (Fact Attack series) p.21 by [[Ian Locke]]; published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1999; {{ISBN|978-0330-374965}}</ref> The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young king in 1889 as \"the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth\".<ref>\"The Happiest Living Monarch\", ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.</ref> His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] to the United States as a result of the [[Spanish–American War]].  At five years old, Alfonso became seriously ill during the [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]].<ref>Kempińska-Mirosławska, B., & Woźniak-Kosek, A. (2013).

Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]]]] By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he stayed in London at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[Edward VII]]. There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.  Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebastián]] in March.  [[File:Anarchist attack on the King of Spain Alfonso XIII (1906).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]] In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jerónimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). The wedding was marked by [[Morral affair|an assassination attempt]] on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed 30 bystanders and members of the procession, while 100 others were wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/|title=Royal Wedding #1: Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg & King Alfonso XIII of Spain|work=Edwardian Promenade|access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref>  On 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907–1938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born. Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.  Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, [[Infante Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]] (1914–1934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/339/1018871276.html|title=Reinas Borbones de cuidado|work=elmundo.es|access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref> From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children.

Alfonso became gravely ill during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed.

Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso ''el Africano'' (\"the African\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=28088|title=Rebelion.

Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the \"Disaster of the Annual\" while he was playing [[golf]]. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say \"Chicken meat is cheap\", before resuming his game.<ref>Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284.</ref> Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost in the battle, which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King was indifferent over the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the ''Cortes'' started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains.  [[File:Alfonso XIII in uniform of a British Field Marshall.jpg|thumb|Alfonso in uniform of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field marshal of the United Kingdom]], 1928]]  After the \"Disaster of the Annual\", Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in [[Málaga]] simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the [[Republic of the Rif|Rif Republic]] was waved about.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> With the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera#Military establishes dictatorship|military coup d'état later in 1923]].<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> On September 13, 1923, General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera]], seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning ''Cortes'' report into the Annual disaster. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era.  ===Downfall and Second Republic=== {{main|Dictablanda of Dámaso Berenguer|1931 Spanish local elections}} On 28 January 1930, amid economic problems, general unpopularity and an impending putschist plot led by General [[Manuel Goded]]{{Sfn|Casals|2004|p=211}} of which Alfonso XIII was most probably aware,{{Sfn|Tuñón de Lara|2000|p=225}} Miguel Primo de Rivera was forced to resign, exiling to [[Paris]], only to die a few weeks later of the complications from [[diabetes]] in combination with the effects of a [[flu]].{{Sfn|Casals|2004|p=214–216}} Alfonso XIII appointed General [[Dámaso Berenguer]] as the new Prime Minister, leading to the period known as the ''[[Dictablanda of Dámaso Berenguer|dictablanda]]''. The King was so closely associated with the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]] that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime that he had supported for almost seven years. The enforced changes relied on the incorrect assumption that Spaniards would accept the notion that nothing had happened after 1923 and that going back to the prior state of things was possible.{{Sfn|Avilés Farré|Elizalde Pérez-Grueso|Sueiro Seoane|2002|p=308}}  In April 1931, General [[José Sanjurjo]] told him that even the army was not loyal.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} On 12 April, the monarchic parties won a thin majority but lost in major cities in the [[1931 Spanish local elections|1931 municipal elections]], which were perceived as a plebiscite on monarchy. Alfonso left the country on night of the 14 to 15 April as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed earlier that day in order to avoid a civil war but did not formally abdicate. He eventually settled in Rome.  By a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of high treason.<ref>See: [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1931/332/A01250-01250.pdf Ley aprobando el acta acusatoria contra D.

This left his third son [[Juan, Count of Barcelona]] his only male heir. Juan later was the father of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].  ===Civil War=== When the Army rose up against the democratically elected Republican Government <ref>Paul Preston, History of the Spanish Civil War</ref> and war broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the  Nationalist military rebels against the Republic, but in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General [[Francisco Franco]], declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as king. (The Nationalist army included many [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of a rival pretender.) Although Alfonso sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936 to participate in the uprising, General [[Emilio Mola]] had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.  On 29 September 1936, upon the death of [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]], the Carlist pretender, Alfonso also became the senior heir of [[Hugh Capet]] and so was hailed by some French [[legitimists]] as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre.  ===Renunciation of claims to the defunct throne and death=== On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII renounced his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died of a heart attack in Rome on 28 February of that year.  In Spain, the ''[[caudillo]]'' Franco ordered three days of national mourning.<ref>\"Mourning in Spain\", ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3.</ref> His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]]. Alfonso was buried in the Church of [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli]], the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of Popes [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]] and [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/03/02/archives/italians-to-mourn-death-of-alfonso-threeday-period-is-orderedtroops.html?sq=Italians+to+Mourn+Death+of+Alfonso&scp=1&st=p \"Italians to Mourn Death of Alfonso,\"] ''The New York Times.'' 2 March 1931.</ref> In January 1980 his remains were transferred to [[El Escorial]] in Spain.<ref>\"21 Guns for Dead King's Homecoming\", ''The Times'' (21 January 1980): 4.</ref>  ==Legacy== Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxurious [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges, [[parador]]es, in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of [[Association football|football]] led to the patronage of several \"Royal\" (\"Real\" in Spanish) football clubs, the first being [[Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña]] in 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Deportivo/history|title=Deportivo history – Football Espana|work=football-espana.net|access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref> Selected others include [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Betis]], [[Real Unión]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], [[Real Zaragoza]] and [[Real Racing Club]].

The story of Ratoncito Pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of Alfonso XIII appearing in some. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque to Ratoncito Pérez on the second floor of \"[[la calle del Arenal]]\".  ==Legitimate and illegitimate children== [[File:Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia with their six children.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|King Alfonso XIII and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Victoria Eugenie]] with their children at [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]'s [[Palacio de la Magdalena]].

However, the word \"amber\" is derived from the [[Middle Persian]] (Pahlavi) word ''ambar'' (variants: ''’mbl, 'nbl'').  ==Formation== Ambergris is formed from a secretion of the [[biliary|bile duct]] in the [[intestines]] of the sperm whale, and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on coastlines. It is sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of dead sperm whales.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten.  Ambergris is passed like fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, but this remains under debate.<ref>{{cite book |author1=William F.

In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926.

He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.  For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1&nbsp;million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a [[conflict of interest]] since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of [[dietary supplement]]s in California.<ref name=\"megerian\">Megerian, Chris.

After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.<ref name=\"mrever\" />  Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. Although significantly taller and heavier, [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning&nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the \"International Star of the Decade\".<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.  That same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman & Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office.

The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |access-date=May 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill |first=Samantha |last=Young |date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105054329/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]].

The [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]–[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.  But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, \"What party is he?\" My friend said, \"He's a Republican.\" I said, \"Then I am a Republican.\" And I have been a Republican ever since.}}, {{Election box candidate with

The ACLU works through [[litigation]] and [[lobbying]] and it has over 1,200,000 members and an annual budget of over $300 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers [[civil liberties]] to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|briefs]] expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.  In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include opposing the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]; supporting [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and the [[LGBT adoption in the United States|right of LGBT people to adopt]]; supporting [[reproductive rights]] such as [[Birth control in the United States|birth control]] and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]]; eliminating [[Discrimination in the United States|discrimination]] against women, [[minority group|minorities]], and [[LGBT]] people; [[decarceration in the United States]]; supporting the [[Prisoners' rights in the United States|rights of prisoners]] and opposing [[Torture and the United States|torture]]; and upholding the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] by opposing government preference for religion over non-religion or for particular faiths over others.  Legally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations, namely the American Civil Liberties Union, a [[501(c)(4)]] social welfare group; and the ACLU Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)]] [[public charity]]. Both organizations engage in [[civil rights]] litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political [[lobbying]].<ref name=\"nonprofit\">{{cite web|title=ACLU and ACLU Foundation: What Is the Difference?|work=American Civil Liberties Union web site|publisher=ACLU|url=https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|access-date=September 5, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190151/https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|archive-date=September 6, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|title = Maximizing Nonprofit Voices and Mobilizing the Public|last = Krehely|first = Jeff|date = 2005|journal = Responsive Philanthropy|access-date = March 10, 2015|pages = 9–10, 15|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134943/http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|archive-date = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The two organizations share office space and employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/images/annualreports/asset_upload_file789_38050.pdf|title = Annual report fiscal year 2007|access-date = March 10, 2015|publisher = American Civil Liberties Union|page = 2}}</ref>  ==Overview== The ACLU was founded in 1920 by a committee including [[Helen Keller]], [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Walter Nelles]], [[Morris Ernst]], [[Albert DeSilver]], [[Arthur Garfield Hays]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and [[Rose Schneiderman]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/03/23/why-free-speech-is-not-enough/|title=Why Free Speech Is Not Enough|last=Cole|first=David|journal=New York Review of Books|date=2017-03-23|access-date=2019-09-23|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref> Its focus was on [[freedom of speech]], primarily for anti-war protesters.<ref name=\"found\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/about-aclu |title=About the ACLU |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref> It was founded in response to the controversial [[Palmer raids]], which saw thousands of radicals arrested in matters which violated their constitutional search and seizures protection.<ref>https://www.aclu.org/about/aclu-history</ref> During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and working with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) to decrease [[racism]] and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating [[police misconduct]] and supporting [[Native American rights]]. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] members and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During [[World War II]], the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]. During the [[Cold War]], the ACLU headquarters was dominated by [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.  By 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand [[civil liberties]]. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce [[separation of church and state]]. It defended several [[anti-war activist]]s during the [[Vietnam War]]. The ACLU was involved in [[Miranda v. Arizona|the ''Miranda'' case]], which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in [[New York Times Co. v. United States|the ''New York Times'' case]], which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of [[creationism]] in public schools and challenged some provisions of [[Patriot Act|anti-terrorism legislation]] as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] and the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.<ref name=\"WeigelResistance\"/>  ==Organization== ===Leadership=== The ACLU is led by a president and an executive director, [[Deborah N.

The ACLU has been criticized by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] such as when it excluded [[communists]] from its leadership ranks, when it defended [[Neo-Nazis]], when it declined to defend [[Paul Robeson]], or when it opposed the passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>Finan, Christopher M.

In 1919, the Court upheld the [[Schenck v. United States|conviction]] of [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] leader [[Charles Schenck]] for publishing anti-war literature.<ref>Walker, p. 26.</ref> In ''[[Debs v. United States]],'' the court upheld the conviction of [[Eugene Debs]]. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat [[freedom of speech]] as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.<ref>Walker, p. 27.</ref>  In 1918, Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues.<ref>Walker, p. 30.</ref> After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.<ref name=W47>Walker, p. 47.</ref>  The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union.<ref name=W47/> Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme.<ref name=W47/> Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchisement]] of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.  During the first decades of the ACLU, Baldwin continued as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks.<ref>Walker, p. 66.</ref> Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary.<ref name=\"Walker\">Walker, p. 70.</ref> The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, and it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state.<ref>Walker, p. 67.</ref> Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the [[Garland Fund]].<ref name=\"Walker\" />  ===Free speech era=== In the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity [[Comstock laws]]; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed.<ref name=\"Walker_a\">Walker, pp. 51–52.</ref> Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic.<ref name=\"Walker_a\" /> In one typical instance in 1923, author [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for trying to read the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] during an [[Industrial Workers of the World]] rally.<ref name=\"Walker_b\">Walker, p. 52.</ref>  [[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Thomas]] was one of the early leaders of the ACLU]] ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations.

For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923.<ref>Walker, p. 61.</ref> There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|government search and seizure]] issues, [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]], or [[wiretapping]].<ref>Walker, p. 68.</ref>  The [[Communist Party USA]] was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU.<ref name=W63>Walker, p. 63.</ref> At the same time, the Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal conduct such as denying their party membership under oath. This led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU.<ref name=W63/> Communist leaders sometimes attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives, whereas Communists tried to disrupt speeches by critics of the USSR.<ref name=W63/> This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.<ref name=W63/>  ===Public schools=== ====Scopes trial==== When 1925 arrived {{en dash}} five years after the ACLU was formed {{en dash}} the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy Tennessee's anti-[[evolution]] law in ''[[Scopes Trial|The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes]]''. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching [[creationism]] in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100.

Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given \"liberal and comprehensive construction\", and it marked a major turning point in the [[civil rights movement]], signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.<ref>Walker, pp. 78–79. The case was in New Jersey, ''State v. Butterworth''. Decision quoted by Walker.</ref>  The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', in which [[Benjamin Gitlow]] was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism.<ref>Walker, p. 79.</ref> Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the [[incorporation doctrine]]) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.<ref>Walker, p. 80.</ref>  ====''Pierce v. Society of Sisters''==== {{main|Pierce v. Society of Sisters}} {{see also|Political activity of the Knights of Columbus}}  After the First World War, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about \"foreign\" values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]].

The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=283}}  The case became known as ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', a seminal [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that significantly expanded coverage of the [[Due Process Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In a unanimous decision, the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.{{sfn|Alley|1999|pp=41–44}} It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.  ===Early strategy=== Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that legislation was the best long-term solution because the Supreme Court could not (and {{en dash}} in his opinion {{en dash}} should not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But [[Walter Pollak]], [[Morris Ernst]], and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties.<ref>Walker, p. 81</ref> A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.<ref>Walker, p. 82. The cases included Gitlow (1925), Whitney (1927), Powell (1932), and Patterson (1935).</ref>  ===Free speech=== [[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|The ACLU defended [[H. L. Mencken]] when he was arrested for distributing banned literature]]  Censorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization.<ref name=W82>Walker, p. 82.</ref> Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature.<ref name=W82/> In that year, [[H. L. Mencken]] deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal.<ref name=W82/> The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'' in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].<ref name=W86>Walker, p. 86.</ref> The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' and ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'' cases.  The [[Comstock laws]] banned distribution of sex education information, based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior<ref name=W85>Walker, p. 85.</ref> [[Mary Ware Dennett]] was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge [[Learned Hand]] ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to \"promote understanding\".<ref name=W85/>  The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature.<ref name=W85/> The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort.<ref name=W85/> By the early 1930s, [[censorship in the United States]] was diminishing.<ref name=W86/>  Two major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] to subject states to the requirements of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref>Walker, p. 90</ref> In ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise [[prior restraint]] and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.<ref>Walker, p. 91.</ref>  ==1930s== The late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States.<ref name=W112>Walker, p. 112</ref> National leaders hailed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy.<ref name=W112/> The 1939 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause.<ref name=W112/> Even conservative elements, such as the [[American Bar Association]] began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.<ref name=W112/>  ===Expansion=== In 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States.<ref name=W86/> Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, [[African American]] rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties.<ref name=W86/> The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.<ref name=W87>Walker, p. 87.</ref>  The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 [[Norris–La Guardia Act]], a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions.<ref name=W87/> The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report ''Lawlessness in Law Enforcement'' in 1931, under the auspices of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Wickersham Commission]].<ref name=W87/> In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.<ref name=W87/>  Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU did engage in educational efforts, and published ''Black Justice'' in 1931, a report which documented [[institutional racism]] throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system.<ref name=W88>Walker, p. 88.</ref> Funded by the [[Garland Fund]], the ACLU also participated in producing the influential [[Margold Report]], which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks.<ref name=W89>Walker, p. 89.</ref><ref>The Margold Report was named after its principal author, [[Nathan Ross Margold]], a white attorney.</ref> The ACLU's plan was to demonstrate that the \"[[separate but equal]]\" policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.<ref name=W89/>  ===Depression era and the New Deal=== In 1932{{spaced ndash}}twelve years after the ACLU was founded{{spaced ndash}}it had achieved significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general.<ref>Walker, p. 92.</ref> But the [[Great Depression]] brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.<ref>Walker, p. 95.</ref>  The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration proposed the [[New Deal]] to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the [[National Recovery Administration]] suspended antitrust legislation.<ref name=W96>Walker, p. 96.</ref> Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many [[civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]] to key positions, including Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a member of the ACLU.<ref name=W96/><ref name=W97>Walker, p. 97</ref>  The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not.<ref name=W97/> In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene.<ref name=W100>Walker, p. 100.</ref> Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's April 11, 1938, issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.<ref name=W99>Walker, pp. 99–100.</ref>  The Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s.<ref name=W98>Walker, p. 98.</ref>  The ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]], which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation.<ref name=W105>Walker, pp. 105–06.</ref> The Supreme Court responded by making a [[The switch in time that saved nine|major shift in policy]], and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.<ref name=W105/>  The first decision that marked the court's new direction was ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'', in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization.<ref name=W106>Walker, p. 106.</ref> The ACLU attorney [[Osmond Fraenkel]], working with [[International Labor Defense]], defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that \"peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.\"<ref>Court decision quoted by Walker, p. 106.</ref> The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by [[Hugo Black]], [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Frank Murphy]]) established a body of civil liberties law.<ref name=W106/> In 1938, Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] wrote the famous \"footnote four\" in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would{{spaced ndash}}henceforth{{spaced ndash}}require compelling justification.<ref name=W107>Walker, p. 107.</ref>  Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] proposed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government.<ref name=W101>Wagner, p. 101.</ref> The newly formed [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to [[Henry Ford]], prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature.<ref name=W102>Walker, pp. 102–03.</ref> Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action.<ref name=W102/> But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech.<ref name=W102/> ACLU leader [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.<ref name=W102/>  The ACLU's support of the NLRB was a major development for the ACLU, because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.<ref name=W103>Walker, p. 103.</ref> Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.<ref name=W103/>  Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal.<ref name=W104>Walker, p. 104.</ref> Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians.

In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose \"presence may endanger national security,\" brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens, and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>  The ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]'s lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney [[A.L. Wirin]] continued to represent [[Ernest Kinzo Wakayama]] but without addressing the case's constitutional questions.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/> (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.)<ref>Walker, p. 142.</ref> However, the San Francisco branch, led by [[Ernest Besig]], refused to discontinue its support for [[Fred Korematsu]], whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney [[Wayne M. Collins|Wayne Collins]], with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>  The West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court, but had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court.<ref name=W138/> ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'' came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast;<ref>Walker, p. 145.</ref> although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an [[Amicus brief|''amicus'' brief]]. Besig, dissatisfied with [[Osmond Fraenkel]]'s tamer defense, filed an additional ''amicus'' brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in ''[[Yasui v. United States]]'' (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ''[[ex parte Endo]]'', was also aided by two ''amicus'' briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>  ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' proved to be the most controversial of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to the national ACLU office's pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside [[Charles Antone Horsky|Charles Horsky]], although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/> The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans,<ref>Walker, pp. 146–47</ref> although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in ''[[coram nobis]]'' proceedings in the 1980s.<ref>Chin, Steven A. ''When Justice Failed: The Fred Korematsu Story'', Raintree, 1992, p. 95.</ref>  The national office of the ACLU was even more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States' war effort.<ref>Walker, p. 157.</ref> Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who [[Renunciation Act of 1944|renounced their US citizenship]] during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for \"repatriation.\" (A significant number of those slated to \"go back\" to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated.) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake Segregation Center]], where the majority of these \"renunciants\" were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support.<ref>{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Niiya |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Ernest%20Besig/ |title=Ernest Besig |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>  During his 1944 visit to Tule Lake, Besig had also become aware of a hastily constructed stockade in which Japanese American internees were routinely being brutalized and held for months without due process. Besig was forbidden by the national ACLU office to intervene on behalf of the stockade prisoners or even to visit the Tule Lake camp without prior written approval from Baldwin. Unable to help directly, Besig turned to Wayne Collins for assistance. Collins, using the threat of habeas corpus suits managed to have the stockade closed down. A year later, after learning that the stockade had been reestablished, he returned to the camp and had it closed down for good.<ref name=yamato>{{Cite news |last=Yamato |first=Sharon |title=Carrying the Torch: Wayne Collins Jr. on His Father's Defense of the Renunciants |newspaper=Discover Nikkei |date=October 21, 2014 |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/10/21/carrying-the-torch/ |access-date=September 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728191547/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/10/21/carrying-the-torch/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=wollenberg49>{{Cite book | last = Wollenberg | first = Charles | title = Rebel Lawyer: Wayne Collins and the Defense of Japanese American Rights | publisher = Heyday | year = 2018 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/rebellawyerwayne00woll/page/49 49–51] | isbn = 978-1597144360 | url = https://archive.org/details/rebellawyerwayne00woll/page/49 }}</ref>  ====End of WWII in 1945==== When the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories.<ref name=W186>Walker, p. 186.</ref> President [[Harry S.

The ACLU was internally divided when it purged Communists from its leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes.<ref>Walker, pp. 175–76.</ref> This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.<ref name=W176201>Walker, pp. 176, 210.</ref>  In 1947, President Truman issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which created the [[Federal Loyalty Program]].

Wilson]]''.<ref name=W231/> The Catholic Church led efforts throughout the 1950s attempting to persuade local prosecutors to ban various books and movies, leading to conflict with the ACLU when the ACLU published it statement condemning the church's tactics.<ref name=W232>Walker, p. 232.</ref> Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as ''[[M (1951 film)|M]]'' and ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|la Ronde]]'', leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship.<ref name=W231/><ref>Walker, p. 235.</ref> Hollywood continued employing self-censorship with its own [[Production Code]], but in 1956 the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code.<ref name=W233>Walker, p. 233.</ref>  The ACLU defended [[beat generation]] artists, including [[Allen Ginsberg]] who was prosecuted for his poem \"[[Howl]]\"; and{{spaced ndash}}in an unorthodox case{{spaced ndash}} the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.<ref>Walker, pp. 232–33.</ref>  The ACLU lost an [[Roth v.

United States (1950)|Henderson v. United States]]'' decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.<ref name=W238/>  In 1954, the ACLU filed an [[amicus brief]] in the case of ''[[Brown v.

The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower-income urban residents, in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the \"one person, one vote\" principle.<ref>Walker, pp. 255–57.</ref>  ===Police misconduct=== The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (right to an attorney), and including 1942's ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (right to an attorney), and 1951's ''[[Rochin v. California]]'' (involuntary stomach pumping).<ref>Walker, p. 246.</ref> In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues.<ref>Walker, p. 247.</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct.<ref>Walker, pp. 246–50.</ref> The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board.<ref>Walker, pp. 246–48.</ref> In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, ''Secret Detention by the Chicago Police'', which documented unlawful detention by police.<ref>Walker, pp. 248–49.</ref>  Some of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home.<ref>Walker, pp. 249–51.</ref> The ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents.<ref>Walker, pp. 252–53.</ref> In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in ''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning.<ref>Walker, p. 250.</ref> And, in 1966, ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] in the following year's ''[[in re Gault]]'' (1967) federal ruling.<ref>Walker, pp. 250–51.</ref> Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers.<ref>Walker, p. 252.</ref> In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.<ref>Walker, p. 274.</ref>  ===Civil liberties revolution of the 1960s=== The 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth.<ref name=\"Walkerpp\">Walker, pp. 257, 261–62.</ref> Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as [[sit in]]s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics.<ref>Walker, pp. 262–64.</ref> The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as [[gay rights]], [[prisoner's rights]], [[abortion]], rights of the poor, and the death penalty.<ref name=\"Walkerpp\" /> Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970.<ref name=W262>Walker, p. 262</ref> In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states.<ref name=W262 /><ref>The count of affiliates is of affiliates with a permanent staff.</ref> During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving [[amicus briefs]] submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested.<ref name=W262 /> At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from \"disengaged and elitist\" to \"emotionally engaged\".<ref>Walker, p. 263. Characterizations by Samuel Walker.</ref> The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled ''How Americans Protest'', which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.<ref>Walker, pp. 263–64.</ref>  African-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students [[Greensboro sit-ins|staged a sit-in]] in a segregated North Carolina department store, the [[sit-in movement]] gained momentum across the United States.<ref>Walker, p. 261.</ref> During 1960–61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.<ref name=W263 /> The ACLU also provided legal help for the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] in 1961, the [[Civil rights movement#Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956–1965|integration of the University of Mississippi]], the [[Birmingham campaign]] in 1963, and the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]].<ref name=W263>Walker, p. 263.</ref>  The NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision.<ref name=W264>Walker, p. 264.</ref> But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors{{spaced ndash}}white and black{{spaced ndash}}who were arrested while protesting in the South.<ref name=W264 /> The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters.<ref>Walker, pp. 264–65.</ref> The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.<ref>Walker, p. 266.</ref>  In 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues.<ref>Walker, p. 267.</ref> Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to [[Charles Morgan Jr.]], the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (''[[Whitus v. Georgia]]''), desegregating prisons (''[[Lee v. Washington]]''), and [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|reforming election laws]].<ref>Walker, pp. 268–69.</ref> The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman [[Julian Bond]] in ''[[Bond v. Floyd]]'', when the [[Georgia House of Representatives|Georgia congress]] refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature.<ref>Walker, pp. 270–71.</ref> Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train [[Green Berets]]. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in ''Parker v. Levy'', 417 US 733 (1974).<ref>Walker, p. 271.</ref>  In 1969, the ACLU won a major victory for free speech, when it defended [[Dick Gregory]] after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when the hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a \"heckler's veto\".<ref>[https://www.aclu.org/successes-american-civil-liberties-union ACLU list of successes]; the case was ''Gregory v. Chicago'', 394 US 111.</ref>  ===Vietnam War=== The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending [[draft resister]]s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the [[Watergate scandal|potential impeachment of Richard Nixon]], and the use of national security concerns to preemptively [[Censorship|censor]] newspapers.  David J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his [[draft card]]. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: ''United States of America v. David J. Miller'', 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', 391 US 367 (1968).<ref name=\"Walker_e\">Walker, p. 280.</ref> Thirteen-year-old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war, and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]''. This critical case established that the government may not establish \"enclaves\" such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeit.<ref name=\"Walker_e\" />  [[File:WCWProtest WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU contends that the Bill of Rights protects individuals who burn the US flag as a form of expression]] The ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]]. In the ''[[Street v. New York]]'' decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression.<ref>Walker, p. 280. Meredith, in fact, was not assassinated.</ref> The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words \"fuck the draft\" on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Cohen v. California]]'', held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.<ref name=W281>Walker, p. 281.</ref>  Non-war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', which held that only speech which advocated ''imminent'' violence could be outlawed.<ref name=W281/>  A major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend [[Benjamin Spock]] and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case.<ref name=W2845>Walker, pp. 284–85.</ref> After the [[Kent State shootings]] in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.<ref>Walker, p. 286.</ref>  Also in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing \"direct\" legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent).<ref name=W285>Walker, p. 285.</ref> Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.<ref name=W285/>  ==1970s and 1980s== ===Watergate era=== [[File:Richard M. Nixon, ca. 1935 - 1982 - NARA - 530679.jpg|thumb|The ACLU was the first national organization to call for the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]]]]  The ACLU supported ''[[The New York Times]]'' in its 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the [[Pentagon papers]]. The court upheld the ''Times'' and ACLU in the ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action.<ref>Walker, pp. 289–90.</ref>  On September 30, 1973, the ACLU became first national organization to publicly call for the impeachment and removal from office of President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{Cite web| last=Jones| first=Glyn| title=ACLU Would Impeach Nixon| url=http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/collection/itempage.jsp?itemid=18506&img=0&level=advanced&transcription=1| work=Greenfield Recorder| publisher=Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association| location=Deerfield, Massachusetts| date=November 10, 1973| access-date=October 16, 2019| id=#L06.052| via=Online Collection – Memorial Hall Museum| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201015708/http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/collection/itempage.jsp?itemid=18506&img=0&level=advanced&transcription=1| archive-date=December 1, 2019| url-status=dead}}</ref> Six civil liberties violations were cited as grounds: “specific proved violations of the rights of political dissent; usurpation of Congressional war‐making powers; establishment of a personal secret police which committed crimes; attempted interference in the trial of Daniel Ellsberg; distortion of the system of justice and perversion of other Federal agencies.”<ref>{{Cite news| title=A.C.L.U.

Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing [[Aryeh Neier]] to take over from Pemberton as Executive Director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU; he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds, and he created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.<ref>Walker, pp. 314–16.</ref>  During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run \"enclaves\", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.<ref>Walker, p. 299. Key ACLU leaders in this effort were [[Ira Glasser]] and [[Aryeh Neier]]</ref> At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs \"enclaves\", which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, members of the military, and prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]]'s use of the phrase \"schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism\" in the ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'' decision.<ref>Raskin, James B. (2009), \"No Enclaves of Totalitarianism\", American University Law Review, Vol. 58:1193.</ref>  The ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the ''Tinker v. Des Moines'' case, and expanded it with cases such as ''[[Goss v. Lopez]]'' which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.<ref>Walker, p. 307.</ref>  As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments.<ref name=W309>Walker, p. 309.</ref> In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community.<ref name=W309/> In the landmark 1975 ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal.<ref name=W309/> The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended [[Billie Boggs]], a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Future Once Happened Here: New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate of America's Big Cities|author=Siegel, F.|date=2013|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=978-1594035555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l73QSrSIcwC|page=205|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>  Prior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights.<ref>Note, \"Beyond the Ken of Courts\", ''Yale Law Journal'' 72 (1963):506. Cited by Walker, p. 310.</ref> That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material.<ref name=W310>Walker, p. 310.</ref> In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney [[Phil Hirschkop]] discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the [[Virginia State Penitentiary strike]], and won an important victory in 1971's ''[[Landman v. Royster]]'' which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways.<ref>Walker, pp. 310–11. The ACLU was not involved in the ''Landman'' case.</ref> In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the [[National Prison Project]]. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as ''[[Ruiz v. Estelle]]'' (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 [[United States Congress|US Congress]] enacted the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.  ===Victim groups=== [[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] co-founded the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in 1971.<ref>Pullman, Sandra (March 7, 2006).

The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the [[National Organization for Women]], including breakthrough cases such as ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'', ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', and '' [[Taylor v. Louisiana]]''.<ref>Walker, pp. 304–05.</ref>  ACLU leader [[Harriet Pilpel]] raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]. In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher. The US District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for \"immorality\" was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher.

In 1980, the Project filed ''Poe v. Lynchburg Training School'' after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated ''[[Walker v. Pierce]]'', the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent [[Medicaid]] patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981–1990, the Project litigated ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'', a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not to comply with a state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. In 1995, the Project filed ''[[Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth]]'', the US's first [[condom]] availability program.  ====Initiatives==== The Reproductive Freedom Project focuses on three ideas: (1) to \"reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country\" (2) to \"block state and federal welfare \"reform\" proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare, unmarried women, or teenagers\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=dejanikus|first=tacie|date=1982-01-01|title=spousal notification upheld in florida suit|jstor=25774248|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=12|issue=2|pages=9}}</ref> and (3) to \"stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphia.pa.networkofcare.org/ps/services/agency.aspx?pid=ACLUofPAClaraBellDuvallReproductiveFreedomProject_1147_12_0|title=ACLU of PA: Clara Bell Duvall Reproductive Freedom Project – Philadelphia|website=Philadelphia.pa|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228161542/http://philadelphia.pa.networkofcare.org/ps/services/agency.aspx?pid=ACLUofPAClaraBellDuvallReproductiveFreedomProject_1147_12_0|archive-date=February 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Project proposes to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation.  ===Privacy=== The [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] is not explicitly identified in the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' (1961) case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a right to privacy.<ref>Walker, pp. 300–01</ref> The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion laws]] starting in 1964, a year before ''Griswold'' was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the [[Support for the legalization of abortion|right to abortion]] as a policy.<ref>Walker, p. 302.</ref> The ACLU led the defense in ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' (1971) which expanded the right of physicians to determine when [[abortion]]s were necessary.<ref>Walker, p. 303.</ref> These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy.<ref>Walker, p. 303. The ACLU did not participate directly in ''Roe v. Wade'', but did lead the effort in the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.</ref> The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on [[interracial marriage]], in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967).  Related to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], which required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]], which provided students the right to access their records; and the [[Privacy Act of 1974|1974 Privacy Act]], which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.<ref>Walker, p. 308.</ref>  ===Allegations of bias=== In the early 1970s, conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal.<ref>Walker, p. 317.</ref> Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Spock's anti-war protests.<ref>Bishop, Joseph W., \"Politics and the ACLU\", ''Commentary'' 52 (December 1971): 50–58. Bishop cited by Walker. Bishop was professor of law at Yale.</ref> Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace [[judicial activism]].<ref name=W318>Walker, p. 318.</ref> Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' violated the [[Original intent|intention of the authors]] of the Bill of Rights.<ref name=W318/> The ACLU became an issue in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential campaign]], when Republican candidate [[George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]] accused Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] (a member of the ACLU) of being a \"card carrying member of the ACLU\".<ref>Walker, pp. 319, 363. Bush quoted by Walker.</ref>  ===The Skokie case=== {{main|National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie}} It is the policy of the ACLU to support the civil liberties of defendants regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as [[George Wallace]], [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], and [[KKK]] members.<ref>Walker, p. 323 (Rockwell); Walker, p. 242 (Wallace).</ref> The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.<ref>Walker, p. 323.</ref>  In 1977, a small group of American Nazis, led by [[Frank Collin]], applied to the town of [[Skokie, Illinois]], for permission to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of [[Nazi concentration camp]]s. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration.<ref name=Skokie>Walker, pp. 323–31.</ref> Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court.<ref name=Skokie/> The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in ''[[National Socialist Party of America v.

The compromise plan permitted the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not \"within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance\" and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise was the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise.

Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have.  The higher the latitude of the area affected, the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area.  So, a [[taiga]] or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors.<ref name=\"wolf\">Wolfe, A.  “Patterns of biodiversity.”  Ohio State University, 2007.</ref>  ===Benefits=== One example of  a situation where abiotic stress plays a constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires.  While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive. Even though it is healthy for an ecosystem, a wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor, because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area.  Every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is a sign of the abiotic stress.  On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress.<ref name=\"bruss\">{{cite journal | last1 = Brussaard | first1 = Lijbert | last2 = de Ruiter | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Brown | first3 = George G. | year = 2007 | title = Soil biodiversity for agricultural sustainability | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 121 | issue = 3| pages = 233–244 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.013}}</ref>  What also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way.  While a flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in a certain area, if there is rice there, it will thrive in the wet conditions. Another example of this is in [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]].  The same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms.  They act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins, but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively, while the [[thermophilic]] zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature. The two may be living in the same environment, but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms.<ref name = \"vine\"/>  Lastly, abiotic stress has enabled species to grow, develop, and evolve, furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of a group of organisms.  Both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes.<ref name=\"roel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roelofs | first1 = D. |display-authors=et al | year = 2008 | title = Functional ecological genomics to demonstrate general and specific responses to abiotic stress | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01312.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 22 | pages = 8–18 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  ===Detriments=== The most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming.  It has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than 50% from their potential yield.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = W. | last2 = Vinocur | first2 = B. | last3 = Altman | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance | doi = 10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5 | pmid = 14513379 | journal = Planta | volume = 218 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | s2cid = 24400025 }}</ref>  Because abiotic stress is widely considered a detrimental effect, the research on this branch of the issue is extensive. For more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress, see the sections below on plants and animals.  ==In plants== A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots.  If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.<ref name=\"bruss\"/>  The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cramer|first1=Grant R|last2=Urano|first2=Kaoru|last3=Delrot|first3=Serge|last4=Pezzotti|first4=Mario|last5=Shinozaki|first5=Kazuo|date=2011-11-17|title=Effects of abiotic stress on plants: a systems biology perspective|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=11|pages=163|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-11-163|issn=1471-2229|pmc=3252258|pmid=22094046}}</ref>  One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell.  High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions.  Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis have led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conde|first=Artur|year=2011|title=Membrane Transport, Sensing and Signaling in Plant Adaptation to Environmental Stress|url=http://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pcp/52/9/10.1093/pcp/pcr107/2/pcr107.pdf?Expires=1485797994&Signature=Cemd6gLc-NOAT39G3-6uNqRUU6r97KGEAOyCNNn2uYjNVPelfxGYMUDxK660bIU6Afj6fNwTfB9pXf9DgOcCqz5CJOjC-bL3H19H1eFUe0Wsid8jnH9J4k30SaaF-arCEmbLrBsTJrWkrsq84THqi0ervfu-4hd~5arrd-ytItFSqkXje1frT3zWxJoosf3~Asfs-5qt50yGImSOXHjVk2LNgZeyD5FKqt7KZReojKLjZnZIUsdHLnDBD4RjF24ezB3mbbNtz8kq60eoiVUFMWlJhkYoD7NYwijrartby2612WMmS1vkKnZ3bT5emRl9qe8trQJarCUlQEKUYp6MDA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q|journal=Plant & Cell Physiology|volume=52 | issue = 9 |pages=1583–1602|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcr107|pmid=21828102}}</ref>  Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment.  It is how plants work together.  In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well.  This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maestre | first1 = Fernando T. | last2 = Cortina | first2 = Jordi | last3 = Bautista | first3 = Susana | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus halepensis and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation | doi = 10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03990.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 27 | issue = 6| pages = 776–786 }}</ref>  Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area.  When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely.  Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.<ref name =\"mitt\"/> [[File:Sunflowers in fields.jpg|thumb|Sunflowers are hyperaccumulator plants that can absorb large amount of metal.]] Serpentine soils (media with low concentrations of nutrients and high concentrations of heavy metals) can be a source of abiotic stress.

A decrease in precipitation and subsequent increase in drought are extremely likely in the future due to an increase in global warming.<ref name=\":1\"/> Plants have come up with many mechanisms and adaptations to try and deal with drought stress. One of the leading ways that plants combat drought stress is by closing their stomata. A key hormone regulating stomatal opening and closing is abscisic acid (ABA). Synthesis of ABA causes the ABA to bind to receptors. This binding then affects the opening of ion channels thereby decreasing turgor pressure in the stomata and causing them to close. Recent studies, by Gonzalez-Villagra, et al., showed how ABA levels increased in drought-stressed plants (2018). They showed that when plants were placed in a stressful situation they produced more ABA to try and conserve any water they had in their leaves.<ref name=\":02\" />  Another extremely important factor in dealing with drought stress and regulating the uptake and export of water is [[aquaporin|aquaporins]] (AQPs). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that make up channels. These channels' main job is the transport of water and other necessary solutes. AQPs are both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally regulated by many different factors such as ABA, GA3, pH and Ca2+ and the specific levels of AQPs in certain parts of the plant, such as roots or leaves, helps to draw as much water into the plant as possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zargar|first1=Sajad Majeed|last2=Nagar|first2=Preeti|last3=Deshmukh|first3=Rupesh|last4=Nazir|first4=Muslima|last5=Wani|first5=Aijaz Ahmad|last6=Masoodi|first6=Khalid Zaffar|last7=Agrawal|first7=Ganesh Kumar|last8=Rakwal|first8=Randeep|date=October 2017|title=Aquaporins as potential drought tolerance inducing proteins: Towards instigating stress tolerance|journal=Journal of Proteomics|volume=169|pages=233–238|doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2017.04.010|pmid=28412527|issn=1874-3919}}</ref> By understanding both the mechanism of AQPs and the hormone ABA, scientists will be better able to produce drought resistant plants in the future.  One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \"memory\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last1=Tombesi|first1=Sergio|last2=Frioni|first2=Tommaso|last3=Poni|first3=Stefano|last4=Palliotti|first4=Alberto|date=June 2018|title=Effect of water stress \"memory\" on plant behavior during subsequent drought stress|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=150|pages=106–114|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.03.009|issn=0098-8472}}</ref> They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed the way they regulated their stomata and what they called \"hydraulic safety margin\" so as to decrease the vulnerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.<ref name=\":1\" />  ==In animals== For animals, the most stressful of all the abiotic stressors is [[heat]].  This is because many species are unable to regulate their internal [[body temperature]].  Even in the species that are able to regulate their own [[temperature]], it is not always a completely accurate system.  Temperature determines [[metabolic rate]]s, [[heart rate]]s, and other very important factors within the bodies of animals, so an extreme temperature change can easily distress the animal's body.  Animals can respond to extreme heat, for example, through natural heat acclimation or by burrowing into the ground to find a cooler space.<ref name=\"roel\"/>  It is also possible to see in animals that a high genetic diversity is beneficial in providing resiliency against harsh abiotic stressors.  This acts as a sort of stock room when a species is plagued by the perils of natural selection.  A variety of galling insects are among the most specialized and diverse herbivores on the planet, and their extensive protections against abiotic stress factors have helped the insect in gaining that position of honor.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goncalves-Alvim | first1 = Silmary J. | last2 = Fernandez | first2 = G.

If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low.  If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.<ref name=\"bruss\"/>  This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related.  It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases.<ref name=\"wolf\"/>  This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  ==See also== *[[Ecophysiology]]  ==References== {{reflist|30em}}  {{modelling ecosystems}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Abiotic Stress}} [[Category:Stress (biological and psychological)]] [[Category:Biodiversity]] [[Category:Habitat]] [[Category:Agriculture]] [[Category:Botany]]\t7903804\tnull\tCitation bot\tnull\tAlter: pages.

Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem.\"}} \"We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari – Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On 10 May 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally.\"</ref><ref name=\"Novik261262\">{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261–262}}. \"Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh’a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (Державин, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156–169).

Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh’a regions.

The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika.

Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for 'Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym 'Albanian.' A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to 'Slavs' (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' ('word'), and by extension, from *''sluti'' ('to speak clearly.') The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' ('mute,’'stammering,’'babbling'), and Greek 'barbarian' (from ''barbaros'' 'those who stammer, babble'). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for 'to speak clearly, to understand.' The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' ('eagle') found on the Albanian national flag.\"</ref> The words ''Shqipëri'' and ''Shqiptar'' are attested from 14th century onward,<ref name=Matasović>{{cite book|last=Matasović|first=Ranko|year=2019|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for Students of Indo European|url=http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/Albanian.pdf|place=Zagreb|page=39}}</ref> but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëreshë'' amongst [[Albanian language|Albanian]] speakers.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\" /><ref name=Matasović /> That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\"/> As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman world]] emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\">{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. \"The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could be a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning \"clearly, intelligibly\". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', \"the Germans\" and \"the German language\" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.\"</ref>  === Historical records === {{see also|Origin of the Albanians}}  Little is known about the Albanian people prior to the 11th century, though a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the [[Bulgarian language]] contains possibly a reference to the Albanian people.<ref name=\"Elsie3\"/> It is preserved in a [[manuscript]] written in the [[Serbo-Croatian Language]] traced back to the 17th century but published in the 20th century by Radoslav Grujic.

Another hypothesis associates the Albanian language with the [[Thracian language]].

This led to discontent among Albanian noblemen, several of whom turned to Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII]]. In late 1274, Byzantine forces helped by local Albanian noblemen capture Berat and Butrint.{{sfnp|Anamali|Prifti|2002|p=201}} Charles' attempt to advance towards Constantinople failed at the [[Siege of Berat (1280–1281)]]. A Byzantine counteroffensive ensued, which drove the Angevins out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, who died in 1285.

In 1299 Andronikos II married his daughter Simonis to Milutin and the lands he had conquered were considered as [[dowry]]. In 1302, [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto]], grandson of Charles, claimed his rights on the Albanian kingdom and gained the support of local Albanian Catholics who preferred him over the Orthodox Serbs and Greeks, as well as the support of [[Pope Benedict XI]]. In the summer of 1304, the Serbs were expelled from the city of Durrës by the locals who submitted themselves to Angevin rule.{{sfnp|Nicol|2010|pp=67–68}}  Prominent Albanian leaders during this time were the [[Thopia family]], ruling in an area between the Mat and Shkumbin rivers,{{sfnp|Norris|1993|p=36}} and the [[Muzaka family]] in the territory between the Shkumbin and Vlorë.{{sfnp|Fine|1994|p=290}} In 1279, Gjon I Muzaka, who remained loyal to the Byzantines and resisted Angevin conquest of Albania, was captured by the forces of Charles but later released following pressure from Albanian nobles.

In 1335 the head of the family, Andrea II Muzaka, gained the title of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] and other Muzakas pursued careers in the Byzantine government in Constantinople.

Before and after the [[fall of Constantinople]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. As a consequence thousands of Albanians from [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and [[Peloponnese]] escaped to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of Albania|Mountains of Albania]].  Under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], a former governor of the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Dibra]], a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted with the formation of the [[League of Lezhë]] in 1444 up until the [[Siege of Shkodra|Siege of Shkodër]] ending in 1479, multiple times defeating the mightiest power of the time led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to gather several of the Albanian principals, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories and proclaiming himself the Lord of Albania (''Dominus Albaniae'' in Latin).<ref name=\"League of Lezhë\">{{cite book |author1=Rob Pickard |title=Analysis and Reform of Cultural Heritage Policies in South-East Europe |date=2008 |isbn=978-92-871-6265-6 |page=16 |edition=Europarat |language=en}}</ref> Skanderbeg consistently pursued the aim relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans.

Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make—up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time—tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurtaş, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre—modern state. The seventeenth—century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya Çelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were 'Arnavud'. He notes that the town of Vučitrn had few speakers of 'Boşnakca'; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peć, and Prizren the 'mountains of Arnavudluk'. Elsewhere, he states that 'the mountains of Peć' lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north—north—west of Peć, in the region of Rozaje to which the Këlmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kılab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north—east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Priština. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kılab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kılab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Priština. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica ('Kılab') and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689–90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.</ref> As the Serbs expelled many Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in Southern Serbia, which the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] had given to the [[Principality of Serbia]], many of them settled in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Jagodic\">{{harvnb|Jagodić|1998}}. para. 1–71.</ref><ref name=\"Uka525354\">{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}. {{hidden||\"Pra, këtu në vazhdim, pas dëbimit të tyre me 1877–1878 do të shënohen vetëm disa patronime (mbiemra) të shqiptarëve të Toplicës dhe viseve tjera shqiptare të Sanxhakut të Nishit.

In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole.\"</ref> They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.<ref name=\"Hall2829\">{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28–29}}. \"The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid.\"</ref><ref name=\"Bintliff137138\">{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137–138}}. \"First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior. Clear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles. Thus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new \"nation-state\" were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace—effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993).\"; p. 140. \"In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period.\"</ref><ref name=\"VeremisKolipoulos2425\">{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24–25}}. \"For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that 'Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess'.\" But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a 'race' apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the 'other races', i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, 'having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks'. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They 'were' Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or 'Arvanites', were readily 'adopted' as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as 'close kinsmen of the Greeks'. 'These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned', commented the committee. 'it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.'\"</ref> Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.  The [[Cham Albanians]] were a group that formerly inhabited a region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] known as [[Chameria]], nowadays [[Thesprotia]] in northwestern Greece.

Muslim Chams were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from Greece during [[World War II]], by an [[EDES|anti-communist resistance group]] (EDES), as a result of some participating in a [[EAM-ELAS|communist resistance group]] (EAM-ELAS) and others [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|collaborating]] with the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].

The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkapı Palace as part of the ''devşirme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s–1970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912–1913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000–40,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912–13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants' children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912–13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor.\"</ref>  In [[Turkey]], the exact numbers of the Albanian population of the country are difficult to correctly estimate.

Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in Naples, Venice and elsewhere.

Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra.

Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra.

The [[history of Bavaria]] includes its earliest settlement by [[Iron Age]] [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, followed by the conquests of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. It became a [[Duchy of Bavaria|stem duchy]] in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. It was later incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], became an independent kingdom after 1806, joined the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a [[States of Germany|state]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bavaria|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Bavaria|website=Britannica|access-date=31 August 2015}}</ref>  Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's large [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] plurality and conservative traditions.<ref name=\"EKD2016\">{{cite web| title = Kirchenmitgliederzahlen Stand 31.12 2016| publisher = ekd.de| access-date = 2018-04-25| url = https://archiv.ekd.de/download/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2016.pdf}}</ref> [[Bavarian people|Bavarians]] have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes a [[Bavarian language|language]], [[Bavarian cuisine|cuisine]], architecture, festivals such as [[Oktoberfest]] and elements of [[The Alps|Alpine]] symbolism.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bavaria – The Local|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20100204/25043|website = The Local|access-date = 2015-08-31|first = The|last = Local}}</ref> The state also has the second largest economy among the [[List of German states by GDP|German states by GDP figures]], giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Eric|title=Germany – A Bavarian Fairy Tale|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2012/s3430858.htm|website=ABC|access-date=31 August 2015}}</ref>  Contemporary Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of [[Franconia]] and [[Swabia]].  ==History== {{Main|History of Bavaria}}{{historical populations|1840|3802515|1871|4292484|1900|5414831|1910|6451380|1939|7084086|1950|9184466|1961|9515479|1970|10479386|1987|10902643|2011|12397614|2019|13124737|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[https://www.statistik.bayern.de/mam/produkte/statistik_kommunal/2018/09.pdf Bayern: Amtliche Statistik]</ref> 2019 data<ref name=popupdate/>}}[[File:Heunischenburg.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric ''[[Heunischenburg]]'', in the vicinity of [[Kronach]]]]  ===Antiquity=== The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the [[Alps]], previously inhabited by [[Celts]], which had been part of the Roman provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Bavarians spoke a Germanic dialect which developed into [[Old High German]] during the early Middle Ages, but, unlike other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups, they probably did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by the Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic [[Boii]], some remaining [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Allemanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Thuringians]], [[Goths]], [[Scirians]], [[Rugians]], [[Heruli]].

Their daughter, [[Theodelinde]], became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, [[Tassilo I of Bavaria|Tassilo I]], tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] around 600. Tassilo's son [[Garibald II of Bavaria|Garibald II]] seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bavaria|url=http://www.guide-to-bavaria.com/en/Bavaria-History.html|website=Guide to Bavaria|access-date=31 August 2015}}</ref>  After Garibald II, little is known of the Bavarians until [[Theodo of Bavaria#Ordinals|Duke Theodo I]], whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onward, he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy. (It is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time.) His son, [[Theodbert of Bavaria|Theudebert]], led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the [[Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|King Liutprand]]. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson [[Hugbert of Bavaria|Hugbert]].

Odilo issued a [[Lex Baiuvariorum|law code for Bavaria]], completed the process of church organization in partnership with [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface]] (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Grifo]]. He was defeated near [[Augsburg]] in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frassetto|first1=Michael|title=The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne [2 Volumes]|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598849967|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6feKDfRM9sYC&pg=PA145 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Early Medieval Europe, 300–1000|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137014283|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZukcBQAAQBAJ }}</ref> [[Saint Boniface]] completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century.  [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] (b. 741 – d. after 796) succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onward. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the [[Danube]] and colonizing these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of [[Regensburg]] in 792, led by his own son [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pépin the Hunchback]]. The king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.  [[File:Bayern nach der Teilung 1392.png|thumb|The Bavarian duchies after the partition of 1392]] For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]] in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. The territory of ''[[Name of Austria|Ostarrichi]]'' was elevated to a duchy in its own right and given to the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberger family]]. This event marks the founding of [[Austria]].  The last, and one of the most important, of the dukes of Bavaria was [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[house of Welf]], founder of Munich, and ''de facto'' the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of [[Saxony]] and Bavaria by his cousin, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (a.k.a. \"Barbarossa\" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as [[fief]] to the [[Wittelsbach]] family, counts palatinate of Schyren (\"Scheyern\" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. The [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] by Rhine (''Kurpfalz'' in German) was also acquired by the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Joel F.|title=Reordering Marriage and Society in Reformation Germany|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521464833|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFeGzFxsBzMC&pg=PA17 }}</ref>  The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] in 1268, [[Swabia]]n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] acquired [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] for his House but released the [[Upper Palatinate]] for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: [[Bavaria-Straubing]], [[Bavaria-Landshut]], [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] and [[Bavaria-Munich]].  In 1506 with the [[Landshut War of Succession]], the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital. The country became one of the Jesuit-supported counter-reformation centers.

During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria ([[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[War of the Austrian Succession]] with the election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburg). From 1777 onward, and after the younger Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Max III Joseph]], Bavaria and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] were governed once again in [[personal union]], now by the Palatinian lines. The new state also comprised the [[Duchy of Jülich|Duchies of Jülich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.  ===Kingdom of Bavaria=== {{Main|Kingdom of Bavaria}} [[File:Bayern von 1800 bis heute.png|thumb|Bavaria in the 19th century and beyond]] When [[Napoleon]] abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a [[Kingdom of Bavaria|kingdom]] in 1806 due, in part, to the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=Paul R.|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0810878921|edition=2|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0ed2hans|url-access=registration|quote=bavaria kingdom 1806 napoleon.}}</ref> Its area doubled after the Duchy of Jülich was ceded to France, as the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. The Duchy of Berg was given to [[Jerome Bonaparte]]. [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] were temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria by the [[Congress of Vienna]].  In return Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] to the west of the [[Rhine]] and [[Franconia]] in 1815.  Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count [[Maximilian Joseph von Montgelas|Montgelas]], followed a strict policy of modernisation; he laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived the monarchy and retain core validity in the 21st century. In May 1808 a first constitution was passed by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=James J.|title=German History, 1770–1866|date=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0198204329|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAEj4vtFR3AC&pg=PA265 }}</ref> being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords (''Kammer der Reichsräte'') and a House of Commons (''Kammer der Abgeordneten''). That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]].  After the rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to power in the early 18th century, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalry of Prussia and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Allied to Austria, it was defeated along with Austria in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was not incorporated into the [[North German Federation|North German Confederation]] of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When [[Franco-Prussian War|France declared war on Prussia in 1870]], all the south German states (Baden, Württemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria) aside from Austria, joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed [[German Empire|''Deutsches Reich'' (German Empire)]] in 1871. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it had some special rights within the federation (such as an army, railways, postal service and a diplomatic body of its own) but the diplomatic body postal service railways were later undone by Wilhelm II who declared them illegal and got rid of the diplomatic service first.  ===Part of the German Empire=== [[File:Map-DR-Bavaria (blau).svg|thumb|left|upright|Bavaria within the [[German Empire]]]] When Bavaria became part of the newly formed German Empire, this action was considered controversial by [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] who had wanted to retain independence from the rest of Germany, as had Austria. As Bavaria had a majority-Catholic population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly [[Protestantism in Germany|Protestant]] northerners of [[Prussia]]. As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence.<ref name=\"Minahan2000\">{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&pg=PA106|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30984-7|pages=106–}}</ref> Although the idea of Bavarian separatism was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, apart from a small minority such as the [[Bavaria Party]], most Bavarians accepted that Bavaria is part of Germany. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  In the early 20th century, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the [[Schwabing]] district of Munich, a center of international artistic activity.

Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house, [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria]]. They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by Franz's presence or absence.  Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the [[Freikorps]], the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The [[Constitution of Bavaria|Bamberg Constitution]] (''{{lang|de|Bamberger Verfassung}}'') was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the [[Weimar Republic]]. Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] led by the [[NSDAP|National Socialists]], and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as [[Nazism|Nazi]] strongholds under the [[Third Reich]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. However, in the crucial [[German federal election, March 1933]], the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.  As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] and was occupied by U.S. troops, becoming a major part of the American Zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] (1945–47) and then of [[Bizone|\"Bizonia\"]].  The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. During the [[Cold War]], Bavaria was part of [[West Germany]]. In 1949, the Free State of Bavaria chose not to sign the Founding Treaty (''Gründungsvertrag'') for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany, opposing the division of Germany into two states, after [[World War II]]. The [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian Parliament]] did not sign the [[Basic Law of Germany]], mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual ''Länder'', but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other ''Länder'' ratified it.

In Munich, the Old Bavarian dialect was widely spread, but nowadays [[High German languages|High German]] is predominantly spoken there. Moreover, by the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of German speakers from Eastern Europe]], Bavaria has received a large population that was not traditionally Bavarian. In particular, the [[Sudeten Germans]], expelled from neighboring [[Czechoslovakia]], have been deemed to have become the \"fourth tribe\" of Bavarians.  ==Flags and coat of arms== {{Main|Flag of Bavaria|Coat of arms of Bavaria}}  ===Flags=== Uniquely among German states, Bavaria has two official flags of equal status, one with a white and blue stripe, the other with white and blue [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenges]].

This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate. * The \"[[Franconian Rake]]\": At the sinister chief, per [[fess]] dancetty, gules, and argent.

This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria. * The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia. * The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms. * The People's Crown (''Volkskrone''): The coat of arms is surmounted by a [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of [[common people|the people]] after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.  ==Geography== [[File:Über dem Spitzsteinhaus (3650068382).jpg|thumb|left|View of the Bavarian Alps]] Bavaria shares international borders with [[Austria]] ([[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Upper Austria]] and [[Vorarlberg]]) and [[Czechia]] ([[Karlovy Vary Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Plzeň Region|Plzeň]] and [[South Bohemian Region]]s), as well as with [[Switzerland]] (across [[Lake Constance]] to the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]). Because all of these countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]], the border is completely open. Neighboring states within Germany are [[Baden-Württemberg]], Hesse, [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]]. Two major rivers flow through the state: the [[Danube]] (''Donau'') and the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The [[Bavarian Alps]] define the border with Austria (including the Austrian federal-states of Vorarlberg, Tyrol and Salzburg), and within the range is the highest peak in Germany: the [[Zugspitze]]. The [[Bavarian Forest]] and the [[Bohemian Forest]] form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czechia and Bohemia.  The major cities in Bavaria are [[Munich]] (''München''), [[Nuremberg]] (''Nürnberg''), [[Augsburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Würzburg]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[Fürth]], and [[Erlangen]].

In the other larger states of Germany, there are ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' which are only administrative divisions and not self-governing entities as the ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' in Bavaria.  ===Counties=== The second communal layer is made up of 71 rural districts (called ''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Landkreis}}'') that are comparable to counties, as well as the 25 independent cities (''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Städte}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Stadt}}''), both of which share the same administrative responsibilities .

Thus far [[Wilhelm Hoegner]] has been the only SPD candidate to ever become Minister-President; notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister [[Franz Josef Strauss]], a key figure among [[West German]] conservatives during the [[Cold War]] years, and [[Edmund Stoiber]], who both failed with their bids for [[Federal Chancellor of Germany|Chancellorship]]. The German [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and the center-right [[Free Voters of Bavaria|Free Voters]] have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.  In the [[Bavaria state election, 2003|2003 elections]] the CSU won a [[Supermajority|⅔ supermajority]] – something no party had ever achieved in postwar Germany. However, in the subsequent [[Bavaria state election, 2008|2008 elections]] the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years.<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html n-tv:Fiasko für die CSU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929151317/http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html |date=29 September 2008 }}</ref> The losses were partly attributed by some to the CSU's stance for an anti-smoking bill.{{elucidate|date=July 2018}} (A first anti-smoking law had been proposed by the CSU and passed but was watered down after the election, after which a referendum enforced a strict antismoking bill with a large majority).  ===Current Landtag <!--update \"current\"-->=== [[File:Bavarian Landtag 2018.svg|thumb|Current composition of the Landtag:{{legend|#EB001F|[[SPD]]: 22 seats}}{{legend|#64A12D|[[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]]: 38 seats}}{{legend|#FFED00|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]: 11 seats}}{{legend|#007E82|[[Free Voters of Bavaria|Free Voters]]: 27 seats}}{{legend|{{Christian Social Union of Bavaria/meta/color}}|[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]: 85 seats}}{{legend|#009EE0|[[Alternative for Germany|AfD]]: 22 seats}}]]  The [[Bavarian state election, 2018|last state elections]] were held on 14 October 2018 in which the CSU lost its absolute majority in the state parliament in part due to the party's stances as part of the federal government, winning 37.2% of the vote; the party's second worst election outcome in its history. The Greens who had surged in the polls leading up to the election have replaced the social-democratic SPD as the second biggest force in the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] with 17.5% of the vote. The SPD lost over half of its previous share compared to 2013 with a mere 9.7% in 2018. The liberals of the FDP were again able to reach the five-percent-threshold in order to receive mandates in parliament after they were not part of the ''Landtag'' after the 2013 elections. Also entering the new parliament will be the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 10.2% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2018-10-14-LT-DE-BY/index.shtml|title=tagesschau.de|last=tagesschau.de|website=wahl.tagesschau.de|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> The center-right Free Voters party gained 11.6% of the vote and formed a government coalition with the CSU which led to the subsequent reelection of Markus Söder as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]].  ===Government=== *[[Cabinet Söder II|Bavaria Cabinet since 12 November 2018]] The [[Constitution of Bavaria]] of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.  Bavaria has a [[unicameral]] ''{{lang|de|[[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]]}}'' (English: State Parliament), elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a ''{{lang|de|Senat}}'', or [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]], whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.  The Bavarian State Government consists of the [[Minister-President of Bavaria]], eleven Ministers and six Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:  * Ministry of the Interior, Building and Transport (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium des Innern, für Bau und Verkehr}}'') * Ministry of Education and Culture, Science and Art (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst}}'') * Ministry of Finance, for Rural Development and Homeland (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Finanzen, für Landesentwicklung und Heimat}}'') * Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft und Medien, Energie und Technologie}}'') * Ministry of Environment and Consumer Protection (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz}}'') * Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Family and Integration (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, Familie und Integration}}'') * Ministry of Justice (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Justiz}}'') * Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten}}'') * Ministry of Public Health and Care Services (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Gesundheit und Pflege}}'')  Political processes also take place in the seven regions (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') in Bavaria, in the 71 administrative districts (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie Städte}}''), and in the 2,031 local authorities (''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'').  In 1995 Bavaria introduced [[direct democracy]] on the local level in a [[referendum]]. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called ''Mehr Demokratie'' (English: More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court tightened the regulations considerably (including by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs—835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.  ====Minister-presidents of Bavaria since 1945==== {{See also|List of Ministers-President of Bavaria}} [[File:7857ri-Markus Soeder.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Markus Söder]], the current Minister-President of Bavaria]] {| class=\"wikitable\" !  style=\"background:#eef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"6\"| Ministers-President of Bavaria |- style=\"background:#eef;\" !

The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between \"States\" and \"Free States\". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|some states]] use the style \"Commonwealth\" rather than \"State\". The choice of \"Free State\", a creation of the 19th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived ''republic'', has historical reasons, Bavaria having been styled that way even before the current 1946 Constitution was enacted (in 1918 after the ''de facto'' abdication of Ludwig III).

Pope emeritus [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI (Joseph Alois Ratzinger)]] was born in [[Marktl am Inn]] in [[Upper Bavaria]] and was [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising|Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. Otherwise, the culturally [[Franconia]]n and [[Swabia]]n regions of the modern State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both Catholic and [[Protestant]] traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 28.8% was [[Protestant]], 0.7% was [[Jewish]], and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik.

Traditional costumes collectively known as [[Tracht]] are worn on special occasions and include in [[Altbayern]] [[Lederhosen]] for males and [[Dirndl]] for females. Centuries-old [[folk music]] is performed. The [[Maypole tradition in Bavaria|Maibaum]], or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's business directory, as figures on the pole represented the trades of the village), and the bagpipes of the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the [[Paganism in the Eastern Alps|ancient Celtic and Germanic]] remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are many traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the [[Aperschnalzen]], competitive [[whipcracking]].  Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or with citizens from other nations Bavarians continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their heritage alive. In New York City the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others which represent a specific part of Germany, including the Bavarian organizations. They present a German parade called [[Steuben Parade]] each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.  ===Food and drink=== {{Main|Bavarian cuisine}} Bavarians tend to place a great value on [[Bavarian cuisine|food and drink]]. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example {{lang|de|[[Weißwurst]]}} (\"white sausage\") or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many [[beer garden]]s, beer is traditionally served by the litre (in a {{lang|de|[[Maß]]}}). Bavarians are particularly proud{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} of the traditional {{lang|de|[[Reinheitsgebot]]}}, or beer purity law, initially established by the [[Duke of Bavaria]] for the City of Munich (i.e. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, [[barley]], and [[hops]]. In 1906 the {{lang|de|Reinheitsgebot}} made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down in 1987 as incompatible with the European common market.<ref>{{cite web |title=30.04.2005 – EU-Recht |url=http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430024608/http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2005 |date=30 April 2005}}</ref> German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|title=To Bier or not to Bier? vom 22.10.2015: Das Reinheitsgebot und seine Tücken – BR Mediathek VIDEO|author=Bayerischer Rundfunk|work=br.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027012032/http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|archive-date=27 October 2015}}</ref> Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 liters per person, although figures have been declining in recent years.  Bavaria is also home to the [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia wine region]], which is situated along the river [[Main (river)|Main]] in Franconia. The region has produced wine (''Frankenwein'') for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the [[Bocksbeutel]] wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.  ===Language and dialects=== [[File:WIKITONGUES- Carolin speaking Bavarian.webm|thumb|left|A native [[Bavarian language]] speaker, recorded in Germany.]] [[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Upper German and the southern counterpart to Central German both form the High German languages, while the [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are in blue]]  Three German dialects are most commonly spoken in Bavaria: [[Austro-Bavarian]] in Old Bavaria (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate), [[Swabian German]] (an [[Alemannic German]] dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (south west) and [[East Franconian German]] in Franconia (North). In the small town [[Ludwigsstadt]] in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, [[Thuringian dialect]] is spoken. During the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak [[Standard German]] (Hochdeutsch), mainly in the cities.  ===Ethnography=== Bavarians consider themselves to be [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and informal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bavaria |url=http://travel-to-germany.info/states/bavaria/ |website=Travel to Germany |publisher=Travel to Germany |access-date=29 September 2020}}</ref> Their sociability can be experienced at the annual [[Oktoberfest]], the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous [[beer garden]]s.

that took place in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[First Balkan War]]. In the [[Second Balkan War]], Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. [[Austria-Hungary]], although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}  By the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912, these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The [[First Balkan War]] began on 8 October 1912, when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire, and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913, when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its loss of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], attacked its former Balkan League allies. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with and invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining Adrianople. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria conserved most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south part of [[Dobruja|Dobruja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911–1918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|page=278}}</ref>  ==Background== {{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}} [[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]  [[File: Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war. They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in 1914.]]  [[File: Meurtre de Nazim Pacha illustration, 9 February 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Nazım Pasha]], the chief of staff of the Ottoman army, was assassinated by [[Young Turks]] due to his failure.]] The background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].  The First Balkan War had some main causes briefly presented below:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}<ref name=\"HellenicNation\">{{cite book |title=Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους|trans-title=History of the Hellenic Nation |language=el |date=1974 |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon |location=Athens, Greece |isbn=9789602131107 |edition=Vol. 14}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}</ref>  # The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples. # The Italo-Ottoman war of 1911 and the Muslims' rebellions of Kosovo and Albania showed that the Empire was deeply \"wounded\" and unable to strike back against another war. # The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution. # The Christian populations of the European part of the Ottoman Empire were  severely oppressed by the Ottoman Reign, and thus the Balkan States were forced to take action. # Most importantly, the Balkan League was formed, and its members were confident that under those circumstances an organised and simultaneous declaration of war to the Ottoman Empire would be the only way to protect their compatriots and expand their territories in the Balkan Peninsula.  ===Policies of the Great Powers=== Throughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Ottoman Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's Lebanon, Syria, and Israel).<ref>M.S. Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774–1923: A Study in International Relations'' (1966) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Eastern_Question_1774_1923.html?id=PsdsAAAAIAAJ online] ]</ref>  [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.<ref>J. A. R. Marriott, ''The Eastern Question An Historical Study In European Diplomacy'' (1940), pp 408–63. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.75728/page/n6/mode/2up Online]</ref>  ===Young Turk Revolution=== {{Main|Young Turk Revolution}} The 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long-defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.<ref>Hasan Unal,  \"Ottoman policy during the Bulgarian independence crisis, 1908–9: Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria at the outset of the Young Turk revolution.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 34.4 (1998): 135–176.</ref>  At the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognized. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has a large influence on the consequent world order.<ref>Marriott, ''The Eastern Question An Historical Study In European Diplomacy'' (1940), pp 433–63.</ref>  ===Reaction in the Balkan States===  Serbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pašić]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).  On 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League sought the creation of a new political system thus summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political advisor. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref name=\"HellenicNation\" /><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclopædia Britannica Online</ref>  Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| access-date =15 April 2008 }}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.  ===Pre-War Treaties===  [[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]  Following the Italian victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911–1912, the severity of the Ottomanizing policy of the Young Turkish regime and a series of three revolts in Ottoman held Albania, the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Christian Balkan countries were forced to take action and saw this as an opportunity to promote their national agenda by expanding in the territories of the falling empire and liberating their enslaved co-patriots. In order to achieve that, a wide net of treaties was constructed and an alliance was formed.  The negotiation among the Balkan States’ governments started in the latter part of 1911 and was all conducted in secret. The treaties and military conventions were published in French translations after the Balkan Wars, on 24–26 of November, in Le Matin, Paris, France <ref name=\"Handbook\">{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Frank Maloy |last2=Hershey |first2=Amos Shartle |title=Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870–1914 |date=1918 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}</ref> In April 1911, Greek PM [[Eleutherios Venizelos]]’ attempt to reach an agreement with the Bulgarian PM and form a defensive alliance against the Ottoman Empire was fruitless, because of the doubts the Bulgarians held on the strength of the Greek Army.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> Later that year, in December 1911, Bulgaria and Serbia agreed to start negotiations in forming an alliance under the tight inspection of Russia. The treaty between Serbia and Bulgaria was signed on 29 of February/13 of March 1912. Serbia sought expansion to \"[[Old Serbia]]\" and as [[Milan Milovanovich]] noted in 1909 to the Bulgarian counterpart, \"As long as we are not allied with you, our influence over the Croats and Slovens will be insignificant\".<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Richard C. |title=The Balkan Wars 1912–1913 Prelude to the First World War |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415229472}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}</ref> On the other side, Bulgaria wanted the autonomy of Macedonia region under the influence of the two countries. The then Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs General [[Stefan Paprikov]] stated in 1909 that, \"It will be clear that if not today then tomorrow, the most important issue will again be the Macedonian Question. And this question, whatever happens, cannot be decided without more or less direct participation of the Balkan States\".<ref name=\"Hall\" /> Last but not least, they noted down the divisions should be made of the Ottoman territories after a victorious outcome of the war. More specifically, Bulgaria would gain all the territories eastern of Rodopi Mountains and River Strimona, while Serbia would annex the territories northern and western of Mount Skardu.<ref name=\"HellenicNation\" />  The alliance pact between Greece and Bulgaria was finally signed on 16/29 of May 1912, without stipulating any specific division of Ottoman territories.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /><ref name=\"Hall\" /> In summer 1912, Greece proceeded on making \"gentlemen's agreements\" with Serbia and Montenegro.<ref name=\"Hall\" /> Despite the fact that, a draft of the alliance pact with Serbia was submitted on 22 of October, a formal pact was never signed due to the outbreak of the war. As a result, Greece did not have any territorial or other commitments, other than the common cause to fight the Ottoman Empire.  In April 1912 Montenegro and Bulgaria reached an agreement including financial aid to Montenegro in case of war with the Ottoman Empire. A gentlemen's agreement with Greece was reached soon after, as mentioned before. By the end of September a political and military alliance between Montenegro and Serbia was achieved.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> By the end of September 1912, Bulgaria had formal-written alliances with Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro. A formal alliance was also signed between Serbia and Montenegro, while Greco-Montenegrin and Greco-Serbian agreements were basically oral \"gentlemen’s agreements\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} All these completed the formation of the Balkan League.  ===Balkan League=== {{Main|Balkan League}}  At that time, the Balkan States had been able to maintain armies that were both numerous, in relation to each country's population, and eager to act, being aspired by the idea that they would free enslaved parts of their homeland.<ref name=\"Hall\" /> The Bulgarian Army was the leading army of the coalition. It was a well-trained and fully equipped army, capable of facing the Imperial Army. It was suggested that the bulk of the Bulgarian Army would be in the Thracian front, as it was expected that the front near the Ottoman Capital would be the most crucial one. The Serbian Army would act in the Macedonian front, while the Greek Army was thought powerless and was not taken under serious consideration. At that time, Greece was needed in the Balkan League only for its navy and its capability to dominate the [[Aegean Sea]], cutting off the Ottoman Armies from reinforcements.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}  On 13/26 of September 1912, the Ottoman mobilization in Thrace forced Serbia and Bulgaria to act and order their own mobilization. On 17/30 of September Greece also order mobilization. On 25 of September/8 of October, Montenegro declared war on the Ottoman Empire, after negotiations failed regarding the border status. On 30 of September/13 of October the ambassadors of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece delivered the common ultimatum to the Ottoman government, which was immediately  rejected. The Empire withdrew its ambassadors from Sofia, Belgrade and Athens, while the Bulgarian, Serbian and Greek diplomats left the Ottoman capital delivering the war declaration on 4/17 of October 1912.<ref name=\"HellenicNation\" />  ==First Balkan War== {{Main|First Balkan War}} [[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]] [[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]  The three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.  The Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26&nbsp;million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three-quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.  With the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.  Montenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[Çatalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait. On 7 November, in response to an Ottoman initiative, they entered into negotiations for the surrender of [[Thessaloniki]]. With the Greeks already there, and the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division moving swiftly from the north towards Thessaloniki, Hassan Tahsin Pasha considered his position to be hopeless. .{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=61}} The Greeks offered more attractive terms than the Bulgarians did. On 8 November, Tahsin Pasha agreed to terms and 26,000 Ottoman troops passed over into Greek captivity. Before the Greeks entered the city, a German warship whisked the former sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] out of Thessaloniki to continue his exile, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. With their army in Thessaloniki, the Greeks took new positions to the east and northeast, including [[Nigrita]]. On 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) Greece expanded its occupied area and teamed up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclopædia Britannica Online.</ref>  On the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeat of the Ottoman fleet, the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}  In January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the Çatalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.  ==Prelude to the Second Balkan War== {{Main|Treaty of London (1913)}} After pressure from the Great Powers towards Greece and Serbia, who had postponed signing in order to fortify their defensive positions, {{sfn|Hall|2000|p=101}} the signing of the Treaty of London took place on 30 May 1913. With this Treaty came the end of the war between the Balkan Allies and the Ottoman Empire. From now on, the Great Powers had the right of decision on the territorial adjustments that had to be made, which even led to the creation of an independent Albania. Every Aegean island belonging to the Ottoman Empire, with the exception of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], was handed over to the Greeks, including the island of [[Crete]].   Furthermore, all European territory of the Ottoman Empire west of the Enos-Midia (Enez-Midye) line, was ceded to the Balkan League, but the division of the territory among the League was not to be decided by the Treaty itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stavrianos |first1=Leften Stavros |title=The BALKANS since 1453 |date=2000 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0-8147-9766-2 |page=537 |url=https://archive.org/details/balkanssince145300lsst |access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref> This event led to the formation of two ‘de facto’ military occupation zones on the Macedonian territory, as Greece and Serbia tried to create a common border. The Bulgarians were not satisfied with their share of spoils and as a result, the Second Balkan War broke out on the night of 29 June 1913, as Bulgaria confronted the Serbian and Greek lines in Macedonia. .{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=539}}  ==Second Balkan War== {{Main|Second Balkan War}} [[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]] [[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912–1913)]]  Though the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29 (16) June 1913,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mazower |first1=Mark |title=Salonica, City of Ghosts |date=2005 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn=0375727388 |page=279 }}</ref> when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.  When the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be an 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedeağaç (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.  Greece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace, and confirming Greek concerns, Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized. A month after the Second Balkan War started, the Bulgarian community of Thessaloniki no longer existed, as hundreds of long-time Bulgarian locals were arrested. Thirteen hundred Bulgarian soldiers and about five hundred [[komitadjis]] were also arrested and transferred to Greek prisons. In November 1913, the Bulgarians were forced to admit their defeat, as the Greeks received international recognition on their claim of Thessaloniki .{{sfn|Mark Mazower|2005|p=280}}  Similarly, in [[North Macedonia]], the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).  The Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties,{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}  On 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web| date= Winter 1995| url= http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| title= THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA| publisher= Magazine: Australia &World Affairs| access-date= 15 April 2008| last= George Phillipov| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archive-date= 20 April 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometers away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.  The Greek army was also successful.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} {{Better source|reason= False citation/page 117 is wrong|date=April 2020}} It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment.

Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Armies, newly arrived from the Serbian front, that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].  [[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis–Lachanas]]]] By 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities. Thus, he agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as had been communicated through Romania.  Romania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} from the center of [[Sofia]].  Seeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to lose all of their land which was officially ceded to Bulgaria as a part of the Sofia conference in 1914  [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].  ==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars== [[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]] [[File:Serbian poster celebrating victory over Bulgarina in the second Balkan war.jpg|thumb|Serbian propaganda poster, depicting king Alexander I beating the losing Bulgarian ruler.]]  The developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers. Although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:  *[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|author-link=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]]. *[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict. *The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there. *[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances—even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania. *[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders—an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.  The '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.  Austria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.  Finally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.  ==Epilogue==  ===The Treaty of Bucharest=== {{Main|Treaty of Bucharest (1913)}}  The epilogue to this nine-month pan-Balkan war was drawn mostly by the treaty of Bucharest, 10 August 1913. Delegates of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria, hosted by the deputy of Romania arrived in Bucharest to settle negotiations. Ottoman's request to participate was rejected, on the basis that the talks were to deal with matters strictly among the Balkan allies.<ref name=\"Hall\" /> The Great Powers maintained a very influential presence, but they did not dominate the proceedings. The Treaty partitioned Macedonia, made changes to the Balkan borders and established the independent state of Albania.<ref name=\"Jelavich\">{{cite book |last1=Jelavich |first1=Barbara |title=History of the Balkans (Twentieth Century) Vol. 2 |date=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=NYC, USA |isbn=9780521274593}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}</ref>  Serbia, gained the territory of north-east Macedonia, settled the eastern borders with Bulgaria and gained the eastern half of the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar, doubling its size.<ref name=\"Jelavich\" /> Montenegro gained the western half of the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar and secured the borders with Serbia. Greece over-doubled its size by gaining southern Epirus, southern Macedonia (the biggest part), including the city-port of Kavala in its eastern border. What is more, the Aegean Islands were annexed by the Greek Kingdom, apart from Dodecanese, and Cretan unification was completed and established. Romania annexed the southern part of Dobruja province. Bulgaria, finally, even though defeated, managed to hold some territorial gains from the First Balkan War. Bulgaria embraced a portion of Macedonia, including the town of Strumnitza, and western Thrace with a 70-mile Aegean littoral including the port-town of Alexandroupolis.<ref name=\"Handbook\" />  ===The Final Treaties===  The Bulgarian delegates then meet the Ottomans for negotiations in Constantinople. Bulgaria's hope to regain lost territories in Eastern Thrace, where the bulk of Bulgarian forces had struggled to conquer and many died, was dashed as the Turks retained the lands they had regained in the counter-attack. The straight line of Ainos-Midia was not accepted for the eastern Border; the regions of Lozengrad, Lyule Burgas-Buni Hisar and Adrianople reverted to the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Hall\" /> After this Treaty of Constantinople, 30 September 1913, Bulgaria sought an alliance with the Ottoman Empire against Greece and Serbia (in support of their claims to Macedonia).  This was followed by the Treaty of Athens, 14 November 1913, between the Turks and Greeks, concluding the conflict between them. However, the status of the Aegean Islands, under the Greek control, was left in a question, especially the islands of Imvros and Tenedos strategically positioned near the Dardanels Straights. Even after signing this treaty, relations between the two countries remained very bad, and war almost broke out in spring 1914.  Finally, a second Treaty in Constantinople re-established the relations between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire, concluding officially the Balkan Wars. Montenegro never signed a pact with the Turks.<ref name=\"Hall\" />  ==Aftermath== [[File:Zapleneti turski topovi od strana na srpskata vojska pred crkata vo Kumanovo, Balkanska vojna, 1912.tif|thumb|Ottoman cannon captured by the [[Royal Serbian Army]] displayed in front of a church in [[Kumanovo]], 1912]] The Balkan Wars brought to an end Ottoman rule of the Balkan Peninsula, except for eastern Thrace and Constantinople. The Young Turk regime was unable to reverse their Empire's decline, but remained in power, establishing a dictatorship in June 1913.<ref name=\"Jelavich\" /> A large influx of Turks fled from the lost lands to the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]]. By 1914, the remaining Empire saw a population increase of around 2.5&nbsp;million. The estimated war dead were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 of wounds, and 82,000 of disease (according to Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' [1960]).  A major issue was the partitioning of these Ottoman territories, inhabited by Greeks, Bulgarians, Aromanians, Serbs, Jews, Turks, Albanians and other nationalities. The new state of Albania was established on lands conquered by Greeks and Serbs. Their armies were asked to leave after the establishment of the new country. Greece never gained North Epirus, and Serbia lost a wide littoral to the Adriatic Sea. This arrangement satisfied Italy and Austro-Hungary's wish to limit a greater and more powerful Serbia.  During and after the wars, the Greek fleet proved the only considerable naval power in the Aegean Sea, blocking the Turkish fleet inside the Dardanelles. The Hellenic Navy managed to liberate the Greek islands and boost the morale of the Greeks. However, the Greek populations in Asia Minor and Pontus faced the rage of the Young Turks' regime, answering for the defeat with embargoes, exiles, persecutions and, finally, genocide.  ==All Balkan War conflicts== ===First Balkan War conflicts=== ====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles==== {| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a [[Psychological trauma|psycho-traumatic]] event amongst many Turks that triggered the ultimate [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the empire itself within five years. [[Nazım Pasha]], Chief of Staff of the [[Ottoman Army]], was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]].<ref>Gul Tokay. \"Ottoman diplomacy, the Balkan Wars and the Great Powers\". In Dominik Geppert, William Mulligan, Andreas Rose, eds. ''The Wars before the Great War'' {{ISBN|978-1-107-06347-1}}, 2015, p. 70</ref>  Most Greeks regard the Balkan Wars as a period of epic achievements. They managed to liberate and gain territories that had been inhabited by Greeks since ancient times and doubled the size of the Greek Kingdom. The Greek Army, very little in numbers and ill-equipped in comparison to the superior Ottoman but also Bulgarian and Serbian armies, won very important battles that made it accountable to the Great Powers' chessplay. Two great personalities rose in the Greek political arena, Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], the leading mind behind the Greek foreign policy, and Crown Prince, and later King, [[Konstantinos I]], the major General of the Greek Army.<ref name=\"HellenicNation\" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mavrogordatos |first1=Georgios |title=1915, Ο Εθνικός Διχασμός |trans-title=1915, The National Division |language=el |date=2015 |publisher=Ekdoseis Patakis |location=Athens |isbn=9789601664989 |pages=33–35 |edition=VIII}}</ref>  ==See also== *[[International relations (1814–1919)]] *[[Ottoman wars in Europe]] *[[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885) *[[Albanian Revolt of 1910]] *[[Albanian Revolt of 1911]] *[[Albanian Revolt of 1912]] *[[Destruction of the Thracian Bulgarians in 1913]] *[[Balkans Campaign (World War I)]] *[[Balkans Campaign (World War II)]] *[[List of places burned during the Balkan Wars]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  == Further reading ==  {{div col}} * Antić, Čedomir.

Luminous intensity is analogous to [[radiant intensity]], but instead of simply adding up the contributions of every [[wavelength]] of light in the source's spectrum, the contribution of each wavelength is [[weighting|weighted]] by the standard [[luminosity function]] (a model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths).<ref name=\"Sharpe\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Wyzecki |first=G. |author2=Stiles, W.S. |year=1982 |edition=2nd |title=Color Science: Concepts and Methods, Quantitative Data and Formulae | isbn = 0-471-02106-7 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}</ref> A common wax [[candle]] emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly one candela. If emission in some directions is blocked by an opaque barrier, the emission would still be approximately one candela in the directions that are not obscured.  The word ''candela'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''candle''. The old name \"candle\" is still sometimes used, as in ''[[foot-candle]]'' and the modern definition of ''[[candlepower]]''.<ref name=Webster>{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/candlepower|title=Candlepower - Definition |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|access-date=15 February 2015}}</ref>  ==Definition== The 26th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) redefined the candela in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Convocation of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (26th meeting) |location=Versailles  |date=13 November 2018 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |format=pdf |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CGPM/Convocation-2018.pdf#page=25 }}</ref> The new definition, which took effect on 20 May 2019, is:  <blockquote>The candela [...] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Hz, ''K''<sub>cd</sub>, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm&nbsp;W<sup>–1</sup>, which is equal to {{nowrap|cd sr W<sup>–1</sup>}}, or {{nowrap|cd sr kg<sup>–1</sup> m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>3</sup>}}, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of ''[[Planck constant|h]]'', ''[[Speed of light in vacuum|c]]'' and [[unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom|Δ''ν''<sub>Cs</sub>]].</blockquote>  ==Explanation== [[File:Linear visible spectrum.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5]] The frequency chosen is in the [[visible light|visible spectrum]] near [[green]], corresponding to a wavelength of about 555&nbsp;nanometres. The [[human eye]], when [[Adaptation (eye)|adapted]] for bright conditions, is most sensitive near this frequency. Under these conditions, [[photopic vision]] dominates the visual perception of our eyes over the [[scotopic vision]]. At other frequencies, more radiant intensity is required to achieve the same luminous intensity, according to the frequency response of the human eye. The luminous intensity for light of a particular wavelength ''λ'' is given by :<math>I_\\mathrm{v}(\\lambda)= 683.002\\ \\mathrm{lm/W} \\cdot \\overline{y}(\\lambda) \\cdot I_\\mathrm{e}(\\lambda) ,</math> where ''I''<sub>v</sub>(''λ'') is the [[luminous intensity]], ''I''<sub>e</sub>(''λ'') is the [[radiant intensity]] and <math>\\textstyle \\overline{y}(\\lambda)</math> is the [[photopic]] [[luminosity function]]. If more than one wavelength is present (as is usually the case), one must integrate over the [[spectrum]] of wavelengths to get the total luminous intensity.  ===Examples=== *A common candle emits light with roughly 1&nbsp;cd luminous intensity.  *A 25&nbsp;W compact fluorescent light bulb puts out around 1700&nbsp;[[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s; if that light is radiated equally in all directions (i.e. over 4''π'' [[steradian]]s), it will have an intensity of <math>I_\\text{V} = \\frac{1700\\ \\text{lm}}{4 \\pi\\ \\text{sr}} \\approx 135\\ \\text{lm/sr} = 135\\ \\text{cd}</math>. *Focused into a 20°&nbsp;beam, the same light bulb would have an intensity of around 18,000&nbsp;cd within the beam.  ==History== Prior to 1948, various standards for luminous intensity were in use in a number of countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a \"standard candle\" of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these was the English standard of candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120&nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|grains]] per hour. Germany, Austria and Scandinavia used the [[Hefnerkerze]], a unit based on the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/hefner.htm |title=Hefner unit, or Hefner candle |work=Sizes.com |date=30 May 2007 |access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref>  It became clear that a better-defined unit was needed. [[Jules Violle]] had proposed a standard based on the light emitted by 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> of [[platinum]] at its melting point (or freezing point), calling this the Violle. The light intensity was due to the [[Planck radiator]] (a [[black body]]) effect, and was thus independent of the construction of the device. This made it easy for anyone to measure the standard, as high-purity platinum was widely available and easily prepared.  The ''[[Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage]]'' (International Commission on Illumination) and the CIPM proposed a “new candle” based on this basic concept. However, the value of the new unit was chosen to make it similar to the earlier unit candlepower by dividing the Violle by 60. The decision was promulgated by the CIPM in 1946: <blockquote>The value of the '''new candle''' is such that the brightness of the full radiator at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60&nbsp;new candles per [[square centimetre]].<ref>{{cite book |title = The Metric System: The International System of Units (SI) |author = Barry N.

In 1967 the 13th CGPM removed the term \"new candle\" and gave an amended version of the candela definition, specifying the atmospheric pressure applied to the freezing platinum: <blockquote>The candela is the luminous intensity, in the perpendicular direction, of a surface of {{nowrap|1&thinsp;/&thinsp;600&thinsp;000}} square&nbsp;metre of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of {{nowrap|101&thinsp;325}}&nbsp;newtons per square&nbsp;metre.<ref>13th CGPM Resolution 5, CR, 104 (1967), and ''Metrologia'', '''4''', 43–44 (1968).</ref></blockquote>  In 1979, because of the difficulties in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by [[radiometry]], the 16th&nbsp;CGPM adopted a new definition of the candela:<ref>16th CGPM Resolution 3, CR, 100 (1979), and ''Metrologia'', '''16''', 56 (1980).</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Base unit definitions: Candela |work = The [[NIST]] Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty |url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html |access-date =27 September 2010}}</ref>  <blockquote> The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540|e=12|ul=hertz}} and that has a [[radiant intensity]] in that direction of {{sfrac|683}}&nbsp;[[watt]] per [[steradian]]. </blockquote>  The definition describes how to produce a light source that (by definition) emits one candela, but does not specify the luminosity function for weighting radiation at other frequencies.  Such a source could then be used to calibrate instruments designed to measure luminous intensity with reference to a specified luminosity function. An appendix to the SI Brochure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_cd_en.pdf |title=''Mise en pratique'' for the definition of the candela and associated derived units for photometric and radiometric quantities in the International System of Units (SI) |work=SI Brochure Appendix 2 |date=July 2015 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |access-date=2017-12-07 }}</ref> makes it clear that the luminosity function is not uniquely specified, but must be selected to fully define the candela.  The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would precisely match the old definition. Although the candela is now defined in terms of the [[second]] (an SI base unit) and the watt (a derived SI unit), the candela remains a base unit of the SI system, by definition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_cd_en.pdf |title=The photometric base unit – the candela |work=SI Brochure |date=7 September 2007 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures }}</ref>  The 26th CGPM approved the modern definition of the candela in 2018 as part of the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units]], which redefined the SI base units in terms of fundamental physical constants.  ==SI photometric light units== {{SI light units}}  ===Relationships between luminous intensity, luminous flux, and illuminance=== If a source emits a known luminous intensity ''I''<sub>v</sub> (in candelas) in a well-defined cone, the total [[luminous flux]] ''Φ''<sub>v</sub> in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s is given by :''Φ''<sub>v</sub>&nbsp;= ''I''<sub>v</sub> 2π [1&nbsp;− cos(''A''/2)],  where ''A'' is the ''radiation angle'' of the lamp—the full vertex angle of the emission cone. For example, a lamp that emits 590&nbsp;cd with a radiation angle of 40° emits about 224&nbsp;lumens. See [[MR16]] for emission angles of some common lamps.<ref>[http://www.theledlight.com/lumens.html Theory]</ref><ref>[http://led.linear1.org/lumen.wiz Online converter]</ref>  If the source emits light uniformly in all directions, the flux can be found by multiplying the intensity by 4π: a uniform 1&nbsp;candela source emits 12.6&nbsp;lumens.  For the purpose of measuring illumination, the candela is not a practical unit, as it only applies to idealized point light sources, each approximated by a source small compared to the distance from which its luminous radiation is measured, also assuming that it is done so in the absence of other light sources. What gets directly measured by a [[light meter]] is incident light on a sensor of finite area, i.e. [[illuminance]] in lm/m<sup>2</sup> (lux). However, if designing illumination from many point light sources, like light bulbs, of known approximate omnidirectionally-uniform intensities, the contributions to illuminance from [[incoherent light]] being additive, it is mathematically estimated as follows. If '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the position of the ''i''-th source of uniform intensity ''I<sub>i</sub>'', and '''â''' is the unit vector [[normal (geometry)|normal]] to the illuminated elemental opaque area ''dA'' being measured, and provided that all light sources lie in the same half-space divided by the plane of this area,  :<math> \\text{illuminance at point } \\mathbf{r}\\text{ on } dA\\text{, } E_v(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum _{i}{ \\frac{|\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_i)|}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3} I_i }.</math> In the case of a single point light source of intensity ''I<sub>v</sub>'', at a distance ''r'' and normally incident, this reduces to :<math> E_v(r) = \\frac{I_v}{r^2}.</math>  ==See also== {{wiktionary}}  ==References== {{Reflist|30em}}  {{SI units}} {{Authority control}}  [[Category:SI base units]] [[Category:UCUM base units]] [[Category:Units of luminous intensity]]\t9784415\tnull\tTom.Reding\tnull\t+{{[[Template:Authority control|Authority control]]}} ([[d:Q83216|1 ID]] from [[Wikidata]]), [[WP:GenFixes]] on\tnull\t2021-02-25 05:34:10.0\ttext/x-wiki\twikitext\tdcio1bjnfjdbx3rdr3tiyeo4zi34zfo\ttrue\tWrappedArray({{Short description|SI unit of luminous intensity}}, {{About|the unit of luminous intensity}}, {{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}, {{Infobox Unit | name = Candela | image = [[File:Luminosity.svg|290px]] | caption = [[Photopic vision|Photopic]] (black) and [[scotopic vision|scotopic]]<ref>[http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/lum/scvl.htm CIE Scotopic luminosity curve (1951)]</ref> (green) luminosity functions.

The main highland cities in the country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and by the [[Pan American Highway]] with [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's [[port]]s are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient capacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't function for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it for city transportation. An August 2016 OECD report provided this summary: \"The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair and only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s, seaports quality and capacity are deficient. Internal transportation overly relies on private road vehicles as the public transport system, especially railways, is inadequate.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/a-bird-eye-view-of-costa-rica-s-transport-infrastructure_5jlswbwvwqjf-en|title=A bird-eye view of Costa Rica's transport infrastructure|first1=Mauro|last1=Pisu|first2=Federico|last2=Villalobos|date=3 August 2016|journal=OECD Economics Department Working Papers|access-date=2 April 2018|doi=10.1787/5jlswbwvwqjf-en|doi-access=free}}</ref>  In a June 2017 interview, President Luis Guillermo Solís said that private sector investment would be required to solve the problems. \"Of course Costa Rica’s infrastructure deficit is a challenge that outlasts any one government and I hope that we have created the foundations for future administrations to continue building. I have just enacted a law to facilitate Public Private Partnerships, which are the ideal way to develop projects that are too large for the government to undertake. For example the new airport that we are building to serve the capital city will cost $2 billion, so it will need private-sector involvement. There is also the potential for a ‘dry canal’ linking sea ports on our Atlantic and Caribbean Coasts that could need up to $16 billion of investment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latam-investor.com/2017/06/interview-president-republic-costa-rica-luis-guillermo-solis/#|title=Interview with the President of the Republic of Costa Rica, Luis Guillermo Solís – LatAm Investor|date=7 June 2017|website=latam-investor.com|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref>  The government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management into the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies of the state.

Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.  Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including [[alpine skiing]], [[ski jumping]] and [[Telemark skiing]]. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on [[ski poles]] against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRrwAAAAMAAJ&q=cross-country+skiing+australia|title=Australian Cross Country Skiing|last=Hampel|first=Ian|date=1988|publisher=Kangaroo Press|isbn=9780864171993|language=en|access-date=13 April 2019|archive-date=28 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228041011/https://books.google.com/books?id=jRrwAAAAMAAJ&q=cross-country+skiing+australia&dq=cross-country+skiing+australia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAir6_lc3hAhWOmeAKHTZ9DPYQ6AEIKjAA|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExVLAAAACAAJ&q=new+zealand+cross+country+skiing+books|title=New Zealand Backcountry Skiing|last=Broadbent|first=James|date=2004|publisher=New Zealand Alpine Club|isbn=9780958242134|language=en|access-date=13 April 2019|archive-date=28 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228094644/https://books.google.com/books?id=ExVLAAAACAAJ&dq=new+zealand+cross+country+skiing+books&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7ztf0ls3hAhVFdt8KHQVnDkoQ6AEIKjAA|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Cross-country skiing (sport)|Competitive cross-country skiing]] is one of the [[Nordic skiing]] sports.

Trail preparation employs snow machines which tow snow-compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets [[homologation]] standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation, or national standards.

The classic technique relies on a [[Ski wax|wax]] or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle from each other in a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>  Poles contribute to forward propulsion, either simultaneously (usual for the skate technique) or in alternating sequence (common for the classical technique as the \"diagonal stride\"). Double poling is also used with the classical technique when higher speed can be achieved on flats and slight downhills than is available in the diagonal stride, which is favored to achieve higher power going uphill.<ref name=\"Rees\"/><ref name=pole/>  ===Classic=== The classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the \"diagonal stride\" variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward-striding foot; with the \"kick-double-pole\" variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride.

Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily \"dominant\" side (\"V1\") or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side (\"V2\"). Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the \"V\" and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Technique & Training: Three steps to skating | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_dec/technique.htm | access-date = 2014-10-20 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141017042359/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_dec/technique.htm | archive-date = 17 October 2014}}</ref> A variant of the technique is the \"marathon skate\" or \"Siitonen step\", where the skier leaves one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.<ref name=\"skixc1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crosscountryskitechnique.com/the-early-development-of-skate-skiing/|title=Swedish Olympic Champion Recalls the Early Development of Skate Skiing – Cross Country Ski Technique|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-18|archive-date=19 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219020144/http://crosscountryskitechnique.com/the-early-development-of-skate-skiing/|url-status=live}}</ref>  ===Turns=== Turns, used while descending or for braking, include the [[snowplough turn|snowplough]] (or \"wedge turn\"),<ref name=PSIA>{{cite web | last = PSIA Standards Committee | title = Cross Country Certification Standards 2014 | publisher = Professional Ski Instructors of America | date = June 2014 | url = http://www.psia-nw.org/wp-content/uploads/PSIA_XC_Standards-2014_FINAL.pdf | access-date = 2014-10-22 | archive-date = 7 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161107220555/http://www.psia-nw.org/wp-content/uploads/PSIA_XC_Standards-2014_FINAL.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> the [[stem christie]] (or \"wedge christie\"),<ref name=PSIA/> [[parallel turn]], and the [[Telemark turn]].

For adult skiers (between 155&nbsp;cm/50&nbsp;kg and 185&nbsp;cm/75&nbsp;kg), recommended lengths are between 180 and 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier's height). Traction comes from a \"grip zone\" underfoot that when bearing the skier's weight engages either a textured gripping surface or a grip wax. Accordingly, these skis are classified as \"waxable\" or \"waxless\". Recreational waxless skis generally require little attention and are adapted for casual use. Waxable skis, if prepared correctly, provide better grip and glide.<ref name=\"Rees\"/><ref name=\"Bergin\">{{cite web|url = http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |title = Back to Basics: A Quick Look at Paste Waxes, Waxless Ski Preparation and Kick Waxing|access-date = 2009-01-25|last = Bergin|first = Ron |year = 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402051820/http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |archive-date = 2 April 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"REIAdvice\">{{cite web|url = http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|title = Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|access-date = 2015-06-29|last = Recreational Equipment, Inc.|year = 2015|archive-date = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150516163933/http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|url-status = live}}</ref>  :When the skier's weight is distributed on both skis, the ski's [[wikt:camber|camber]] diminishes the pressure of the grip zone on the snow and promotes bearing on the remaining area of the ski—the \"glide zone\". A test for stiffness of camber is made with a piece of paper under the skier's foot, standing on skis on a flat, hard surface—the paper should be pinned throughout the grip zone of the ski on which all the skier's weight is placed, but slide freely when the skier's weight is bearing equally on both skis.<ref name = Mountaineers/> * '''Skate skis''': Designed for skiing on groomed surfaces. Recommended lengths are between 170 and 200 centimetres (up to 110% of the skier's height) for adult skiers.  The entire bottom of each skate ski is a glide zone—prepared for maximum glide. Traction comes from the skier pushing away from the edge of the previous ski onto the next ski.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> * '''Back country skis''': Designed for [[ski touring]] on natural snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, depending on height and weight of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater [[sidecut]] helps to carve turns.<ref name=Berg/><ref>{{cite web | last = Editors | title = How to choose the right ski length | work = Back Country | date = 2 September 2013 | url = http://www.backcountry.com/explore/how-to-pick-the-right-ski-length | access-date = 2014-10-22 | archive-date = 23 October 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141023055824/http://www.backcountry.com/explore/how-to-pick-the-right-ski-length | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=Melbye/>  :The geometry of a back country ski depends on its purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks.<!---We don't see these terms in English: (referred to as mountain skis or crust skis)---> Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from [[ski skins]], which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.<ref name=Berg/><ref name=Melbye>{{cite book|last1=Melbye|first1=Mats|title=Friluftsliv i vinterfjellet|date=1997|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-00-42088-4|pages=31–32}}</ref>  ====Gliding surface==== {{main article|Ski wax#Glide wax}} Glide waxes enhance the speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then polishing the ski bottom.  Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost.  Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] are common for recreational use.  Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harvey | first = Ian | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 9 February 2011 | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5429 | access-date = 2014-10-21 | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425075240/http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5429 | url-status = live }}</ref> Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions.

[[Ski wax#Grip wax|Grip waxes]] are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions).<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called ''klister''.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>   ===Boots and bindings=== [[File:Cross-country ski boot and binding system--Classic.jpg|thumb|Cross-country ski boot and ''standardized'' binding system for classic skiing. The skier clicks the toe of the boot into the binding and releases with the button in front of the boot.]] [[Ski boots]] are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).<ref name=Boot-binding/>  [[Ski binding|Bindings]] connect the boot to the ski. There are three primary groups of [[Nordic Integrated System|binding systems]] used in cross-country skiing (in descending order of importance):<ref name=Boot-binding>{{cite web | last = Dzierzak | first = Lou | title = Cross country skiers venture off track | department = On the Wild Side | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | access-date = 2014-10-21 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150302164504/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | archive-date = 2 March 2015}}</ref> * '''Standardized system''': Boots and bindings have an integrated connection, typically a bar across the front end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding. * '''Three-pin''': The boot-gripping system comprises three pins that correspond to three holes in the sole of the boot's toe, used primarily for back-country skiing. * '''Cable''': A [[Cable binding|cable]] secures the free-moving heel and keeps the toe of the boot pushed into a boot-gripping section, used primarily for back-country and telemark skiing.  ===Poles=== {{main article|Ski pole}} Ski poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from [[aluminium]], [[fibreglass-reinforced plastic]], or [[carbon fibre]], depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of wood or [[bamboo]].  They feature a foot (called a basket) near the end of the shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing.<ref name=pole>{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Poling Principles | department = Training & Technique | work = Cross Country Skier | date = February 2004 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | access-date = 2014-11-18 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024911/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | archive-date = 29 November 2014}}</ref> Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill.

Chemical\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|loc=Affinity, Chemical}}</ref>  Chemical affinity can also refer to the tendency of an [[atom]] or compound to combine by [[chemical reaction]] with atoms or compounds of unlike composition.  == History ==  ===Early theories=== The idea of ''affinity'' is extremely old.  Many attempts have been made at identifying its origins.<ref name=\"Levere\" />  The majority of such attempts, however, except in a general manner, end in futility since \"affinities\" lie at the basis of all [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], thereby pre-dating [[science]].<ref>Malthauf, R. P. (1966). The Origins of Chemistry. Pg. 299. London.</ref>  [[Physical chemistry]], however, was one of the first branches of science to study and formulate a \"theory of affinity\".  The name ''affinitas'' was first used in the sense of chemical relation by German philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] near the year 1250.  Later, those as [[Robert Boyle]], [[John Mayow]], [[Johann Glauber]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Georg Stahl]] put forward ideas on elective affinity in attempts to explain how [[heat]] is evolved during [[combustion reactions]].<ref>Partington, J.R. (1937). ''A Short History of Chemistry.'' New York: Dover Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-486-65977-1}}</ref>  The term ''affinity'' has been used figuratively since c. 1600 in discussions of structural relationships in chemistry, [[philology]], etc., and reference to \"natural attraction\" is from 1616. \"Chemical affinity\", historically, has referred to the \"[[electromagnetic force|force]]\" that causes [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>[[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. (1831). ''A System of Chemistry'', vol. 1. p.31 (chemical affinity is described as an \"unknown force\"). 7th ed., 2 vols.</ref> as well as, more generally, and earlier, the ″tendency to combine″ of any pair of substances. The broad definition, used generally throughout history, is that chemical affinity is that whereby substances enter into or resist decomposition.<ref name=\"Levere\" >{{cite book | last = Levere | first = Trevor, H. | title = Affinity and Matter – Elements of Chemical Philosophy 1800-1865 | publisher = Gordon and Breach Science Publishers | year = 1971 | isbn = 2-88124-583-8}}</ref>   The modern term chemical affinity is a somewhat modified variation of its eighteenth-century precursor \"elective affinity\" or elective attractions, a term that was used by the 18th century chemistry lecturer William Cullen.<ref>See Arthur Donovan, Philosophical Chemistry in the Scottish Enlightenment, Edinburgh, 1975</ref> Whether Cullen coined the phrase is not clear, but his usage seems to predate most others, although it rapidly became widespread across Europe, and was used in particular by the Swedish chemist [[Torbern Olof Bergman]] throughout his book {{lang|la|De attractionibus electivis}} (1775).  Affinity theories were used in one way or another by most chemists from around the middle of the 18th century into the 19th century to explain and organise the different combinations into which substances could enter and from which they could be retrieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Elements, Principles and the Narrative of Affinity|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|date=2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1023/B:FOCH.0000035061.02831.45|s2cid=143754994|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770609}}</ref><ref>On the variety of affinity theories, see Georgette Taylor, Variations on a Theme; Patterns of Congruence and Divergence among 18th Century Affinity Theories, VDM Verlag Dr Muller Aktiengesellschaft, 2008</ref>  [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in his famed 1789 ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]] (Elements of Chemistry)'', refers to Bergman's work and discusses the concept of elective affinities or attractions.  According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Reactions'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] led to the replacement of the term \"affinity\" by the term \"[[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]\" in much of the English-speaking world.  According to Prigogine,<ref>I.Prigogine. (1980). ''From being to becoming. Time and Complexity in the Physical Sciences''. San Francisco: W.H.Freeman and Co</ref> the term was introduced and developed by [[Théophile de Donder]].<ref>de Donder, T. (1936). ''L'affinité''. Ed. Pierre Van Rysselberghe. Paris: Gauthier-Villars</ref>  [[Goethe]] used the concept in his novel [[Elective Affinities]] (1809).  ===Visual representations === The affinity concept was very closely linked to the visual representation of substances on a table.  The first-ever ''affinity table'', which was based on [[displacement reaction]]s, was published in 1718 by the French chemist [[Étienne François Geoffroy]].  Geoffroy's name is best known in connection with these tables of \"affinities\" (''tables des rapports''), which were first presented to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1718 and 1720, as shown below:  <center> [[Image:Affinity-table.jpg|500px|center|thumb|Geoffroy's '''Affinity Table''' (1718): At the head of the column is a substance with which all the substances below can combine, where each column below the header is ranked by degrees of \"'''affinity'''\".]] </center>  During the 18th century many versions of the table were proposed with leading chemists like Torbern Bergman in Sweden and Joseph Black in Scotland adapting it to accommodate new chemical discoveries.  All the tables were essentially lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different [[reagent]]s.  Crucially, the table was the central graphic tool used to teach chemistry to students and its visual arrangement was often combined with other kinds diagrams.  Joseph Black, for example, used the table in combination with chiastic and circlet diagrams to visualise the core principles of chemical affinity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178–196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508|volume=29|pmid=26103754}}</ref>  Affinity tables were used throughout Europe until the early 19th century when  they were displaced by affinity concepts introduced by [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Claude Berthollet]].  ==Modern conceptions== In [[chemical physics]] and [[physical chemistry]], '''chemical affinity''' is the electronic property by which dissimilar [[chemical species]] are capable of forming [[chemical compounds]].<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911 loc=Affinity, Chemical\"/>  Chemical affinity can also refer to the tendency of an [[atom]] or compound to combine by [[chemical reaction]] with atoms or compounds of unlike composition.  In modern terms, we relate affinity to the phenomenon whereby certain atoms or molecules have the tendency to aggregate or bond.  For example, in the 1919 book ''Chemistry of Human Life'' physician George W. Carey states that, \"Health depends on a proper amount of iron phosphate Fe<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in the blood, for the molecules of this salt have chemical affinity for oxygen and carry it to all parts of the organism.\" In this antiquated context, chemical affinity is sometimes found synonymous with the term \"magnetic attraction\".  Many writings, up until about 1925, also refer to a \"law of chemical affinity\".  [[Ilya Prigogine]] summarized the concept of affinity, saying, \"All chemical reactions drive the system to a state of [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] in which the ''affinities'' of the reactions vanish.\"  ==Thermodynamics==  The present [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition is that affinity ''A'' is the negative [[partial derivative]] of [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' with respect to [[extent of reaction]] ''ξ'' at constant [[pressure]] and [[temperature]].<ref>[http://www.IUPAC.org IUPAC Green Book and Gold Book in .pdf]</ref> That is, :<math>A = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\xi}\\right)_{P,T}.</math>  It follows that affinity is positive for [[Spontaneous process|spontaneous reactions]].  In 1923, the Belgian mathematician and physicist [[Théophile de Donder]] derived a relation between affinity and the Gibbs free energy of a [[chemical reaction]].  Through a series of derivations, de Donder showed that if we consider a mixture of [[chemical species]] with the possibility of chemical reaction, it can be proven that the following relation holds:  :<math> A = -\\Delta_rG. \\,</math>  With the writings of [[Théophile de Donder]] as precedent, [[Ilya Prigogine]] and Defay in ''Chemical Thermodynamics'' (1954) defined chemical affinity as the rate of change of the uncompensated [[heat]] of reaction ''Q''' as the [[Stoichiometry|reaction progress variable]] or reaction extent ''ξ'' grows infinitesimally:  :<math>A  = \\frac{{\\mathrm d}Q'}{{\\mathrm d}\\xi}. \\, </math>  This definition is useful for quantifying the factors responsible both for the state of equilibrium systems (where {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 0}}), and for changes of state of non-equilibrium systems (where ''A'' ≠ 0'').  == See also == *[[Chemistry]] *[[Chemical bond]] *[[Electronegativity]] *[[Electron affinity]] *[[Étienne François Geoffroy]] — Geoffroy's 1718 Affinity Table *[[Valency (chemistry)|Valency]] *[[Affinity chromatography]] *[[Affinity electrophoresis]]  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==References==  *{{EB1911|wstitle=Affinity, Chemical}}  ==External links== * [[William Whewell]].

It provides additional tools for debtors as well. Most importantly, {{usc|11|1108}} empowers the trustee to operate the debtor's business. In Chapter 11, unless a separate trustee is appointed for cause, the debtor, as debtor in possession, acts as trustee of the business.<ref>{{usc|11|1107}}</ref>  Chapter 11 affords the debtor in possession a number of mechanisms to restructure its business. A debtor in possession can acquire financing and loans on favorable terms by giving new lenders first priority on the business's earnings. The court may also permit the debtor in possession to reject and cancel contracts. Debtors are also protected from other litigation against the business through the imposition of an [[automatic stay]]. While the automatic stay is in place, creditors are stayed from any collection attempts or activities against the debtor in possession, and most litigation against the debtor is stayed,<ref name=\"law.cornell.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|title=11 U.S. Code §&nbsp;362 – Automatic stay|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref> or put on hold, until it can be resolved in bankruptcy court, or resumed in its original venue.

All creditors are entitled to be heard by the court.<ref>1 U.S.C. Sec. 1109 (b)</ref> The court is ultimately responsible for determining whether the proposed plan of reorganization complies with bankruptcy laws.  One controversy that has broken out in bankruptcy courts concerns the proper amount of disclosure that the court and other parties are entitled to receive from the members of the creditor's committees that play a large role in many proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/166ef296-0abb-11df-b35f-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html|title=Bankruptcy Rules Committee rethinks 2019 pricing disclosure amid HF panic attack|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref>  === Chapter 11 plan === Chapter 11 usually results in reorganization of the debtor's business or personal assets and debts, but can also be used as a mechanism for liquidation. Debtors may \"emerge\" from a chapter 11 bankruptcy within a few months or within several years, depending on the size and complexity of the bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code accomplishes this objective through the use of a bankruptcy plan. The debtor in possession typically has the first opportunity to propose a plan during the period of exclusivity. This period allows the debtor 120 days from the date of filing for chapter 11 to propose a plan of reorganization before any other party in interest may propose a plan. If the debtor proposes a plan within the 120-day exclusivity period, a 180-day exclusivity period from the date of filing for chapter 11 is granted in order to allow the debtor to gain confirmation of the proposed plan.<ref name=\"law.cornell.edu\" /> With some exceptions, the plan may be proposed by any party in interest.<ref>{{usc|11|1121}}</ref> Interested creditors then vote for a plan.  === Confirmation === If the judge approves the reorganization plan and the creditors all agree, then the plan can be confirmed. If at least one class of creditors objects and votes against the plan, it may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of [[cramdown]] are met. In order to be confirmed over the creditors' objection, the plan must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and the plan must be found fair and equitable to that class. Upon confirmation, the plan becomes binding and identifies the treatment of debts and operations of the business for the duration of the plan. If a plan cannot be confirmed, the court may either convert the case to a liquidation under chapter 7, or, if in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, the case may be dismissed resulting in a return to the status quo before bankruptcy. If the case is dismissed, creditors will look to non-bankruptcy law in order to satisfy their claims.  In order to proceed to the confirmation hearing, a disclosure statement must be approved by the bankruptcy court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkland.com/siteFiles/kirkexp/publications/2365/Document1/Friedland%20-%20Confirming%20a%20Plan.pdf|title=Confirming a Plan|last=Ayer, Bernstein &  Friedland|first=John D., Michael & Jonathan P.|date=January 2015|website=DailyDAC}}</ref> Once the disclosure statement is approved, the plan proponent will solicit votes from the classes of creditors. Solicitation is the process by which creditors vote on the proposed confirmation plan. This process can be complicated if creditors fail or refuse to vote. In which case, the plan proponent might tailor his or her efforts in obtaining votes, or the plan itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2008/08/failure-of-creditor-class-to-cast-vote-on-chapter-11-plan-does-not-equate-to-acceptance|title=Failure of Creditor Class to Cast Vote on Chapter 11 Plan Does Not Equate to Acceptance {{!}} Insights {{!}} Jones Day|website= [[jonesday.com]]|language=en|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> The plan may be modified before confirmation, so long as the modified plan meets all the requirements of Chapter 11.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics|title=Chapter 11 – Bankruptcy Basics|website=United States Courts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Commercial Banking Litigation|last=Friedland, Vandesteeg & Hammeke|first=Jonathan P., Elizabeth B. & Robert|publisher=Thomson Reuters|year=2019|isbn=978-1-539-23368-8|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|pages=§10:7}}</ref>  === Automatic stay === Like other forms of bankruptcy, petitions filed under chapter 11 invoke the [[automatic stay]] of §&nbsp;362. The automatic stay requires all creditors to cease collection attempts, and makes many post-petition debt collection efforts void or voidable. Under some circumstances, some creditors, or the [[United States Trustee]], can request the court convert the case into a liquidation under chapter 7, or appoint a trustee to manage the debtor's business. The court will grant a motion to convert to chapter 7 or appoint a trustee if either of these actions is in the best interest of all creditors. Sometimes a company will liquidate under chapter 11 (perhaps in a 363 sale), in which the pre-existing management may be able to help get a higher price for divisions or other assets than a chapter 7 liquidation would be likely to achieve.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Liquidation Of Troubled Businesses: Chapter 11 Liquidations Increasing|url=https://ccbjournal.com/articles/liquidation-troubled-businesses-chapter-11-liquidations-increasing|access-date=2020-07-14|website=CCBJ|language=en}}</ref>  === Executory contracts === In the new millennium, airlines have fallen under intense scrutiny for what many see as abusing Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a tool for escaping labor contracts, usually 30-35% of an airline's operating cost.<ref>{{cite web|title=massachusetts institute of technology: Airline Data Project|url=http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/Employees&Compensation.html|publisher=MIT}}</ref> Every major US airline has filed for Chapter 11 since 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Richard|title=AMR Files for Bankruptcy: The Last Giant to Fall|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/american-airlines-plunges-into-bankruptcy/|access-date=19 May 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=Nov 29, 2011}}</ref> In the space of 2 years (2002–2004) US Airways filed for bankruptcy twice<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Margeret|title=US Airways Files....Again|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/july-dec04/usairways_9-13.html|access-date=19 May 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service|date=Sep 13, 2004}}</ref> leaving the [[AFL-CIO]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Jablonski|first=Donna|title=AFL-CIO Cries Foul|url=http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Economy/TWU-Demands-Respect-from-American-Airlines-Bankruptcy-Court|publisher=AFL-CIO|access-date=19 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603150718/http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Economy/TWU-Demands-Respect-from-American-Airlines-Bankruptcy-Court|archive-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> pilot unions and other airline employees claiming the rules of Chapter 11 have helped turn the United States into a [[corporatocracy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trumbul|first=Mark|title=AMR Files for Chapter 11|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/1129/AMR-What-does-Chapter-11-bankruptcy-mean-for-American-Airlines-fliers|access-date=19 May 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=Nov 29, 2011}}</ref>  === Priority === Chapter 11 follows the same priority scheme as other bankruptcy chapters. The priority structure is defined primarily by §&nbsp;507 of the Bankruptcy Code ({{usc|11|507}}).  As a general rule, administrative expenses (the actual, necessary expenses of preserving the bankruptcy estate, including expenses such as employee wages, and the cost of litigating the chapter 11 case) are paid first.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/503|title=11 U.S. Code §&nbsp;503 – Allowance of administrative expenses|access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref> [[Secured creditor]]s—creditors who have a [[security interest]], or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], in the debtor's property—will be paid before unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors' claims are prioritized by §&nbsp;507. For instance the claims of suppliers of products or employees of a company may be paid before other unsecured creditors are paid. Each priority level must be paid in full before the next lower priority level may receive payment.  === Section 1110 === Section 1110 ({{usc|11|1110}}) generally provides a secured party with an interest in an aircraft the ability to take possession of the equipment within 60 days after a bankruptcy filing unless the airline cures all defaults. More specifically, the right of the lender to take possession of the secured equipment is not hampered by the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  === Subchapter V === In August 2019, the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019 (“SBRA”) added [[Subchapter V]] to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Subchapter V, which took effect in February 2020, is reserved exclusively for the small business debtor with the purpose of expediting bankruptcy procedure and economically resolving small business bankruptcy cases.  Subchapter V retains many of the advantages of a traditional Chapter 11 case without the unnecessary procedural burdens and costs. It seeks to increase the [[Debtor|debtor's]] ability to negotiate a successful reorganization and retain control of the business and increase oversight and ensure a quick reorganization.  A Subchapter V case contrasts from a traditional Chapter 11 in several key aspects: It's earmarked only for the “small business debtor” (as defined by the Bankruptcy Code), so, only a debtor can file a plan of [[reorganization]]. The SBRA requires the U.S. Trustee appoint a “subchapter V trustee” to every Subchapter V case to supervise and control estate funds, and facilitate the development of a consensual plan. It also eliminates automatic appointment of an official committee of unsecured creditors and abolishes quarterly fees usually paid to the U.S. Trustee throughout the case. Most notably, Subchapter V allows the small business owner to retain their equity in the business so long as the reorganization plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to each class of claims or interests.  == Considerations == The reorganization and court process may take an inordinate amount of time, limiting the chances of a successful outcome and sufficient [[debtor-in-possession financing]] may be unavailable during an economic recession. A preplanned, pre-agreed approach between the debtor and its creditors (sometimes called a [[prepackaged bankruptcy|pre-packaged bankruptcy]]) may facilitate the desired result. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the \"protection\" of the court until it emerges.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} An example is the [[airline industry]] in the United States; in 2006 over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.<ref>{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = https://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | access-date = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}</ref> These airlines were able to stop making debt payments, break their previously agreed upon labor union contracts, freeing up cash to expand routes or weather a price war against competitors — all with the bankruptcy court's approval.

One 2007 study<ref name=\"WSJSpurn\">(January 24, 2007), \"Small Firms Spurn Chapter 11\", ''Wall Street Journal'', page B6B</ref> found this was because businesses were turning to bankruptcy-like proceedings under state law, rather than the federal bankruptcy proceedings, including those under chapter 11. Insolvency proceedings under state law, the study stated, are currently faster, less expensive, and more private, with some states not even requiring court filings. However, a 2005 study<ref name=\"WSJSpurn\" /> claimed the drop may have been due to an increase in the incorrect classification of many bankruptcies as \"consumer cases\" rather than \"business cases\".

Datsun's original production run began in 1931. From 1958 to 1986, only vehicles exported by Nissan were identified as Datsun. By 1986, Nissan had phased out the Datsun name, but re-launched it in June 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for [[emerging markets]].

When Nissan took control of DAT in 1934, the name \"Datson\" was changed to \"Datsun\", because \"son\" also means \"loss\" ('''損''' ''son'') in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and also to honour the sun depicted in the national flag &ndash; thus the name ''Datsun'': {{nihongo|Dattosan|'''ダットサン'''|''Dattosan''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Consumano |first=Michael A. |quote=Also, the symbol was derived from [lemons] which are famous in Japan |title=The Japanese Automobile Industry |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |year=1985 |isbn=9780674472556 |page=33}}</ref> Nissan phased out the Datsun brand in March 1986.

The new car's name was an acronym of the surnames of the following company partners:  *{{nihongo|[[Den Kenjirō|Kenjirō '''D'''en]]|田 健次郎|''Den Kenjirō''}} *{{nihongo|Rokurō '''A'''oyama|青山 禄朗|''Aoyama Rokurō''}} *{{nihongo|Meitarō '''T'''akeuchi|竹内 明太郎|''Takeuchi Meitarō''}}.<ref name=BBCMar2012/>  Incidentally, ''datto'' (how a native Japanese speaker would pronounce \"dat\") means to \"dash off like a startled rabbit\" (脱兎), which was considered a good name for the little car.<ref name=shiTak>{{cite journal | journal = Motor Magazine International | date = January 1974 | title = A Look Behind Japanese Automotive Names | last = Takashima | first = Shizuo | pages = 91–92 | volume = 2 | number = 1 | location = Tokyo, Japan }}</ref> The firm was renamed Kaishinsha Motorcar Co. in 1918, seven years after their establishment and again, in 1925, to DAT Motorcar Co. DAT Motors constructed trucks in addition to the DAT passenger cars. In fact, their output focused on trucks since there was almost no consumer market for passenger cars at the time. Beginning in 1918, the first DAT trucks were assembled for the military market. The low demand from the military market during the 1920s forced DAT to consider merging with other automotive industries.

Nissan also built the [[Nissan Patrol|4W60 Patrol]], based on the Willys Jeep, and the 4W70 Carrier, based on the [[Dodge M37]]. Not until January 1955 did Datsun offer a fully indigenous design.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.495\"/>  That year, the Occupation returned production facilities to Japanese control, and Datsun introduced the [[Nissan Bluebird#110 series|110]] [[Sedan (car)|saloon]] and the 110-based [[Datsun Truck#Datsun 120/220|120]] [[Pickup truck|pickup]].<ref name=\"Daniels, p.495\"/>  ===Datsun in the American market=== [[File:Datsun logo.png|thumb|right|The \"classic\" Datsun logo, based on the [[Flag of Japan]] and Japan's [[Names of Japan|nickname]] as the \"Land of the Rising Sun\". After the Nissan rebrand, the logo remained the same, with \"Datsun\" replaced by \"Nissan\".]]  The use of the ''Datsun'' name in the American market derives from the name Nissan used for its production cars. In fact, the cars produced by Nissan already used the Datsun brand name, a successful brand in Japan since 1932, long before [[World War II]]. Before the entry into the American market in 1958, Nissan did not produce cars under the Nissan brand name, but only trucks. Their in-house-designed cars were always branded as ''Datsuns''. Hence, for Nissan executives it would be only natural to use such a successful name when exporting models to the United States. Only in the 1960s did Datsun begin to brand some automobile models as ''Nissans'', like the [[Nissan Patrol#Second generation (60; 1959–1980)|Patrol]] and a small test batch of about 100 [[Nissan Cedric#First generation 30|Cedric]] luxury sedans,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-life/may-be-oldest-surviving-nissan-north-america |title=This may be the oldest surviving Nissan in North America |first=Jay |last=Ramey |work=Autoweek  |location=US |date=17 September 2013 |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref> and then not again until the 1980s. The [[Japanese domestic market|Japanese market]] [[Nissan Z-car|Z-car]] (sold as the Fairlady Z) also had Nissan badging. In the United States, the Nissan branch was named \"''Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A.''\", and chartered on September 28, 1960, in California, but the small cars the firm exported to America were still named Datsun.  Corporate choice favored Datsun, so as to distance the parent factory Nissan's association by Americans with Japanese military manufacture. In fact Nissan's involvement in Japan's military industries was substantial. The company's car production at the Yokohama plant shifted towards military needs just a few years after the first passenger cars rolled off the assembly line, on April 11, 1935. By 1939 Nissan's operations had moved to [[Manchuria]], then under Japanese occupation, where its founder and President, [[Yoshisuke Ayukawa]], established the Manchurian Motor Company to manufacture military trucks.  Ayukawa, a well-connected and aggressive risk taker, also made himself a principal partner of the Japanese Colonial Government of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halberstam |first=David |title=The Reckoning |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |isbn=9780380721474}}</ref> Ultimately, Nissan Heavy Industries emerged near the end of the war as an important player in Japan's war machinery. After the war ended, [[Soviet Union]] seized all of Nissan's Manchuria assets, while the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation Forces]] made use of over half of the [[Yokohama]] plant. [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] had Ayukawa imprisoned for 21 months as a [[war crime|war criminal]]. After release he was forbidden from returning to any corporate or public office until 1951. He was never allowed back into Nissan, which returned to passenger car manufacture in 1947 and to its original name of Nissan Motor Company Ltd. in 1949.  [[File:SPL212.jpg|thumb|right|Datsun Fairlady]]  [[United States armed forces|American service personnel]] in their teens or early twenties during the Second World War would be in prime car-buying age by 1960, if only to find an [[economic system|economical]] small second car for their growing family needs. [[Yutaka Katayama]] (Mr. \"K\"), former president of Nissan's American operations, would have had his personal wartime experiences in mind supporting the name Datsun. Katayama's visit to Nissan's Manchuria truck factory in 1939 made him realise the appalling conditions of the assembly lines, leading him to abandon the firm.<ref>“Yutaka Katayama; A Man Who Realized a Dream in America\", 1998 Z Car Club Association, pg 71.</ref> In 1945, near the end of the war, Katayama was ordered to return to the Manchurian plant, however he rebuffed these calls and refused to return.  [[File:Datsun 240Z.jpg|thumb|Datsun 240Z (US model)]]  Katayama desired to build and sell passenger cars to people, not to the military; for him, the name \"''Datsun''\" had survived the war with its purity intact, not \"''Nissan''\". This obviously led Katayama to have problems with the corporate management. The discouragement felt by Katayama as regards his prospects at Nissan, led to his going on the verge of resigning, when Datsun's [[Mobil Economy Run|1958 Australian Mobilgas victories]] vaulted him, as leader of the winning Datsun teams, to national prominence in a [[Post-Occupation Japan|Japan bent on regaining international status]].  The company's first product to be exported around the world was the [[Nissan Bluebird#210/211 series|113]], with a [[Nissan D engine|proprietary]] {{convert|25|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}} {{convert|850|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[four-cylinder engine]].<ref>Daniels, p.496 caption.</ref>  Datsun entered the American market in 1958, with sales in California.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\">Daniels, p.496.</ref> By 1959, the company had dealers across the U.S.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> and began selling the [[Nissan Bluebird#310/311/312 series|310]] (known as Bluebird domestically).<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> From 1962 to 1969 the [[Nissan Patrol]] utility vehicle was sold in the United States (as a competitor to the [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] J40 series), making it the only Nissan-badged product sold in the US prior to that name's introduction worldwide decades later.  From 1960 on, exports and production continued to grow. A new plant was built at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Oppama]], south of [[Yokohama]]; it opened in 1962. The next year, Bluebird sales first topped 200,000, and exports touched 100,000.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> By 1964, Bluebird was being built at 10,000 cars a month.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/>  For 1966, Datsun debuted the [[Datsun 1000|1000]], allowing owners of {{convert|360|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[kei car|kei]] cars to move up to something bigger.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> That same year, Datsun won the [[Safari Rally|East African Safari Rally]] and merged with [[Prince Motors]], giving the company the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] model range, as well as a test track at Murayama.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/>  The company introduced the [[Datsun 510|Bluebird 510]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> This was followed in 1968 with the iconic [[Datsun 240Z|240Z]], which proved affordable [[sports car]]s could be built and sold profitably: it was soon the world's #1-selling sports car.<ref>Daniels, pp.496–497.</ref> It relied on an engine based on the Bluebird and used Bluebird suspension components.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.497\">Daniels, p.497.</ref> It would go on to two outright wins in the East African Rally.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.497\"/>  Katayama was made Vice President of the Nissan North American subsidiary in 1960, and as long as he was involved in decision making, both as North American Vice President from 1960 to 1965, and then President of Nissan Motor Company U.S.A. from 1965 to 1975, the cars were sold as Datsuns. “What we need to do is improve our car’s [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] gradually and creep up slowly before others notice. Then, before [[Detroit]] realizes it, we will have become an excellent car maker, and the customers will think so too.

His rise to its leadership position occurred in 1957 in part because of his handling of the critical Nissan workers' strike that began May 25, 1953, and ran for 100 days. During his tenure as president, Kawamata stated that he \"regretted that his company did not imprint its corporate name on cars, the way [[Toyota]] does. 'Looking back, we wish we had started using Nissan on all of our cars,' he says. 'But Datsun was a pet name for the cars when we started [[export]]ing.'\"<ref>Business Week, 7 April 1973, pg. 69.</ref>  Ultimately, the decision was made to stop using the brand name ''Datsun'' worldwide, in order to strengthen the company name ''Nissan''.  \"The decision to change the name Datsun to Nissan in the U.S. was announced in the autumn (September/October) of 1981. The rationale was that the name change would help the pursuit of a [[global strategy]]. A single name worldwide would increase the possibility that advertising campaigns, brochures, and promotional materials could be used across countries and simplify product design and manufacturing. Further, potential buyers would be exposed to the name and product when traveling to other countries. Industry observers, however, speculated that the most important motivation was that a name change would help Nissan market stocks and bonds in the U.S. They also presumed substantial [[Human ego|ego]] involvement, since the [[Consumer confusion|absence]] of the Nissan name in the U.S. surely rankled Nissan executives who had seen [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] become household words.\"<ref>Aaker, David A. ''Managing Brand Equity : Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name'', New York: The Free Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-02-900101-3}} Chapter 3, Pg. 57</ref>  Ultimately, the name change campaign lasted for a three-year period from 1982 to 1984 – Datsun badged vehicles had been progressively fitted with small \"Nissan\" and \"Datsun by Nissan\" badges from the late 1970s onward until the Nissan name was given prominence in 1983 – although in some export markets, vehicles continued to wear both the Datsun and Nissan badges until 1986.  In the United Kingdom for example, the Nissan name initially was used as a prefix to the model name, with Datsun still being used as the manufacturer's name (e.g. Datsun-Nissan [[Nissan March|Micra]]) from 1982 until 1984.  The name change had cost Nissan a figure in the region of US$500 million. Operational costs included the changing of signs at 1,100 Datsun dealerships, and amounted to US$30 million. Another US$200 million were spent during the 1982 to 1986 advertising campaigns, where the ''\"Datsun, We Are Driven!\"'' campaign (which was adopted in late 1977 in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and subsequent [[1979 energy crisis]]) yielded to ''\"The Name is Nissan\"'' campaign (the latter campaign was used for some years beyond 1985). Another US$50 million was spent on Datsun advertisements that were paid for but stopped or never used.<ref>[http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm What's in a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508085037/http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm |date=2006-05-08 }} – ZCCA</ref> Five years after the [[Brand equity|name change program]] was over, ''Datsun'' still remained more familiar than ''Nissan''.<ref>Aaker, pg 56.</ref>  ===Datsun truck=== [[FIle:Nissan Datsun Truck D22 011.JPG|thumb|right|Nissan Datsun]]  In 2001, [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] marketed its [[Nissan Frontier|D22]] pick-up model in Japan with the name ''Datsun''.

Set in a [[cyberpunk]]-themed [[dystopia]]n world in the year 2052, the game follows [[JC Denton]], an agent of the fictional agency United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO), who is given superhuman abilities by [[Nanotechnology in fiction|nanotechnology]], as he sets out to combat hostile forces in a world ravaged by inequality and a deadly plague. His missions entangle him in a conspiracy that brings him into conflict with the [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]], [[Majestic 12]], and the [[Illuminati]].  ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s gameplay combines elements of the [[first-person shooter]] with [[stealth game|stealth]] elements, [[adventure game|adventure]], and [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] genres, allowing for its tasks and missions to be completed in a variety of ways, which in turn lead to differing outcomes. Presented from the [[first-person (gaming)|first-person]] perspective, the player can customize Denton's various abilities such as weapon skills or lockpicking, increasing his effectiveness in these areas; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player can complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with [[experience points]] to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.  Powered by the [[Unreal Engine]], the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in June 2000, with a [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] port following the next month. A modified version of the game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2002. In the years following its release, ''Deus Ex'' has received additional improvements and content from its fan community.  The game received critical acclaim, including being named \"Best PC Game of All Time\" in ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s \"Top 100 PC Games\" in 2011 and a poll carried out by the UK gaming magazine ''[[PC Zone]]''. It received several Game of the Year awards, drawing praise for its pioneering designs in player choice and multiple narrative paths. Deus Ex has been regarded as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the best video games of all time]]. It has sold more than 1 million copies, as of April 23, 2009. The game led to a [[Deus Ex|series]], which includes the sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' (2003), and three prequels: ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' (2011), ''[[Deus Ex: The Fall]]'' (2013), and ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'' (2016).  == Gameplay == ''Deus Ex'' incorporates elements from four [[video game genre]]s: [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[first-person shooter]], [[adventure game|adventure]], and \"[[immersive sim]]ulation,\" the last of which being a game where \"nothing reminds you that you're just playing a game.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3114/postmortem_ion_storms_deus_ex.php |last=Spector |first=Warren |title=Postmortem: Ion Storm's ''Deus Ex'' |date=2000-12-06 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=July 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227075340/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3114/postmortem_ion_storms_deus_ex.php |archive-date=February 27, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For example, the game uses a [[Point of view (literature)#Other types and uses|first-person]] camera during gameplay and includes exploration and character interaction as primary features.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" />  The player assumes the role of JC Denton, a [[Nanotechnology in fiction|nanotech]]-augmented operative of the [[United Nations]] Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO).<ref name=\"dxmanual\">''Deus Ex'' game manual</ref> This nanotechnology is a central gameplay mechanism and allows players to perform [[superhuman]] feats.  === Role-playing elements === As the player accomplishes objectives, the [[player character]] is rewarded with \"skill points.\" Skill points are used to enhance a character's abilities in eleven different areas, and were designed to provide players with a way to customize their characters;<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> a player might create a combat-focused character by increasing proficiency with pistols or rifles, while a more furtive character can be created by focusing on lock picking and computer hacking abilities.

The player might add [[Telescopic sight|scopes]], [[Suppressor|silencers]], or [[laser sight]]s; increase the weapon's [[range of a projectile|range]], [[accuracy]], or [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] size; or decrease its [[recoil]] and reload time; as appropriate to the weapon type.  Players are further encouraged to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—[[cybernetic]] devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install a maximum of nine, as each must be used on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso.<ref>{{cite news|title=Deus Ex @ GameBanshee|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/deusex/augmentations.php|access-date=2007-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153307/http://www.gamebanshee.com/deusex/augmentations.php|archive-date=2007-12-24|url-status=live}}</ref> This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.  Interaction with [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) was a significant design focus.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> When the player interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a [[cutscene]]-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting from a list of dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g., rudeness makes them less likely to assist the player).  === Combat elements === ''Deus Ex'' features combat similar to first-person shooters, with [[real time (media)|real-time]] action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, including the use of cover, strafing, and \"[[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]].\" A ''[[USA Today]]'' reviewer found, \"At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is puréed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Berman |first=A.S. |title=''Deus Ex'': Breathing new life into a tired genre |newspaper=USA Today |date=2000-08-10 |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/deusex.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621233333/http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/deusex.html |archive-date=2007-06-21 |access-date=2007-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, through the game's role-playing systems, it is possible to develop a character's skills and augmentations to create a [[tank (computer gaming)|tank]]-like combat specialist with the ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Non-player characters will praise or criticize the main character depending on the use of force, incorporating a moral element into the gameplay.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson |first=Adam J. |title=Morality Play – Creating Ethics in Video Games |date=2003-12-18 |url=http://www.adamjthompson.com/thought/CreatingEthics.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011354/http://www.adamjthompson.com/thought/CreatingEthics.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2007-08-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>  ''Deus Ex'' features a [[Heads-up display (video games)|head-up display]] crosshair, whose size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use; the [[reticle]] expands while the player is moving or shifting their aim, and slowly shrinks to its original size while no actions are taken.<ref name=\"dxmanual\" /> How quickly the reticle shrinks depends on the character's proficiency with the equipped weapon, the number of accuracy modifications added to the weapon, and the level of the \"Targeting\" nano-augmentation.  ''Deus Ex'' features twenty-four weapons, ranging from [[crowbar (tool)|crowbars]], [[electroshock weapon]]s, and riot [[Club (weapon)|baton]], to [[laser guidance|laser-guided]] [[anti-tank]] [[rocket]]s and [[assault rifle]]s;<ref name=\"dxmanual\" /> both lethal and [[non-lethal weapon]]s are available. The player can also make use of several weapons of opportunity, such as [[fire extinguisher]]s.  === Player choice === [[File:How to pass obstacles in Deus Ex.jpg|thumb|left|Players are given multiple ways to traverse obstacles, from lockpicking to armed combat.]]  Gameplay in ''Deus Ex'' emphasizes player choice. Objectives can be completed in numerous ways, including [[Stealth game|stealth]], sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and specific aspects of the story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.  Because of its design focus on player choice, ''Deus Ex'' has been compared with ''[[System Shock]]'', a game that inspired its design.<ref name=\"kierongillen\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer\"/> Together, these factors give the game a high degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly different experiences, depending on which methods they use to accomplish objectives.  === Multiplayer === ''Deus Ex'' was designed as a [[single-player]] game, and the initial releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] functionality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110605223321/http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archive-date=2011-06-05 |title=Interview with Warren Spector |work=www.gaming-age.com |last=Klepek |first=Patrick |access-date=2006-12-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through [[patch (computing)|patches]].<ref name=\"gamespy2\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december00/dxmp/index2.shtm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324101150/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december00/dxmp/index2.shtm |archive-date=March 24, 2008 |title=''Deus Ex'' goes Multiplayer |work=Gamespy |author=John \"Warrior\" Keefer |access-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |date=December 2000 }}</ref> The component consists of three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]].

Mysterious groups such as [[Majestic 12]], the [[Illuminati]], the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Bilderberg Group]], and the [[Trilateral Commission]] also either play a central part in the plot or are alluded to during the course of the game.  The plot of ''Deus Ex'' depicts a society on a slow spiral into chaos. There is a massive division between the rich and the poor, not only socially, but in some cities physically. A lethal [[pandemic]], known as the \"Gray Death\", ravages the world's population, especially within the [[United States]], and has no cure. A synthetic [[vaccine]], \"Ambrosia\", manufactured by the company VersaLife, nullifies the effects of the virus but is in critically short supply. Because of its scarcity, Ambrosia is available only to those deemed \"vital to the [[social order]]\", and finds its way primarily to government officials, military personnel, the rich and influential, scientists, and the intellectual elite. With no hope for the common people of the world, riots occur worldwide, and some terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden, among them the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) of the U.S. and a French group known as Silhouette.<ref name=\"KotakuPredictive\"/>  To combat these threats to the world order, the [[United Nations]] has expanded its

Through these missions, JC is reunited with his brother, Paul, who is also nano-augmented. JC tracks the Ambrosia shipment to a private terminal at [[LaGuardia Airport]].

Manderley orders JC to fly to [[Hong Kong]] to eliminate Tracer Tong, a hacker whom Paul has contact with, and who can disable the kill switches. Instead, JC returns to Paul's apartment to find Paul hiding inside. Paul further explains his defection and encourages JC to also defect by sending out a distress call to alert the NSF's allies. Upon doing so, JC becomes a wanted man by UNATCO, and his kill switch is activated by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Director Walton Simons. JC is unable to escape UNATCO forces, and both he and Paul (provided he survived the raid on the apartment) are taken to a secret prison below UNATCO headquarters. An entity named \"Daedalus\" contacts JC and informs him that the prison is part of [[Majestic 12]], and arranges for him and Paul to escape. The two flee to Hong Kong to meet with Tong, who deactivates their kill switches. Tong requests that JC infiltrate the VersaLife building. Doing so, JC discovers that the corporation is the source for the Gray Death, and he can steal the plans for the virus and destroy the universal constructor (UC) that produces it.<ref name=\"daedalusplague\">'''Daedalus:''' Majestic 12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control.

JC meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett and learns that the technology behind the Gray Death was intended to be used for [[Human enhancement|augmentation]], but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, stole and repurposed it. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife's UC, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], where X-51, a group of former [[Area 51]] scientists, have built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) borne out of the [[ECHELON]] program.  Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12's communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but Page counters by releasing his own AI, Icarus. Icarus merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, which can control all global communications. Savage enlists JC's help in procuring schematics for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12's raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the schematics and transmits them to Savage. Page intercepts the transmission and launches a [[nuclear missile]] at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51, now Majestic 12's headquarters, will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC can reprogram the missile to strike Area 51.  JC travels to Area 51 to confront Page. Page reveals that he seeks to merge with Helios and gain full control over nanotechnology. JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously. All three factions ask for his help in defeating Page while furthering their own objectives.

The game's working title was ''Shooter: Majestic Revelations'', and it was scheduled for release on Christmas 1998.<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> The team developed the setting before the [[game mechanics]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} Noticing his wife's fascination with ''[[The X-Files]]'', Spector connected the \"real world, millennial weirdness, [and] conspiracy\" topics on his mind and decided to make a game about them that would appeal to a broad audience.<ref name=\"GameSlice p1\"/> The ''Shooter'' design document cast the player as an [[Human enhancement|augmented]] agent working against an elite cabal in the \"dangerous and chaotic\" 2050s.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\" /> It cited ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]'', and ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' as game design influences, and used the stories and settings of ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'', ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', ''[[Robocop]]'', ''The X-Files'', and ''[[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black]]'' as reference points.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\" /> The team designed a [[Statistic (role-playing games)|skill system]] that featured \"special powers\" derived from nanotechnological augmentation and avoided the inclusion of [[Dice#Application in role-playing games|die rolling]] and skills that required micromanagement.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52–3}} Spector also cited [[Konami]]'s 1995 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden]]'' as an inspiration, stating that the limited [[Dialog tree|choices]] in ''Suikoden'' inspired him to expand on the idea with more meaningful choices in ''Deux Ex''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/11/10/how-suikoden-influenced-deus-ex-and-epic-mickey/|website=Siliconera|title=How Suikoden Influenced Deus Ex And Epic Mickey|date=November 10, 2012|author=Ishaan|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref>  In early 1998, the ''Deus Ex'' team grew to 20 people, and the game entered a 28-month production phase.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The development team consisted of three programmers, six designers, seven artists, a writer, an associate producer, a \"tech\", and Spector. Two writers and four testers were hired as contractors.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Chris Norden was the lead programmer and assistant director, [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] the lead designer, Jay Lee the lead artist, and Sheldon Pacotti the lead writer.<ref name=\"PC Zone: best ever\" /> Close friends of the team who understood the intentions behind the game were invited to [[playtest]] and give feedback. The wide range of input led to debates in the office and changes to the game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector later concluded that the team was \"blinded by promises of complete creative freedom\", and by their belief that the game would have no budget, marketing, or time restraints.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} By mid-1998, the game's title had become ''Deus Ex'', derived from the [[Latin]] [[literary device]] ''[[deus ex machina]]'' (\"god from the machine\"), in which a plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention.<ref name=\"RPGFan: machina\" />  Spector felt that the best aspects of ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s development were the \"high-level vision\" and length of preproduction, flexibility within the project, testable \"proto-missions\", and the [[Unreal Engine]] license.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52–55}} The team's pitfalls included the management structure, unrealistic goals, underestimating risks with [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], their handling of proto-missions, and weakened morale from bad press.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=56–58}}  ''Deus Ex'' was released on June 23, 2000, and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The team planned third-party [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ports]] for [[Mac OS 9]] and [[Linux]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}}  === Design === The original 1997 design document for ''Deus Ex'' privileges character development over all other features.<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> The game was designed to be \"genre-busting\": in parts [[simulation game|simulation]], [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[first-person shooter]], and [[adventure game|adventure]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team wanted players to consider \"who they wanted to be\" in the game, and for that to alter how they behaved in the game.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> In this way, the game world was \"deeply simulated\", or realistic and believable enough that the player would solve problems in creative, [[Emergent gameplay|emergent]] ways without noticing distinct puzzles.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> However, the simulation ultimately failed to maintain the desired level of openness, and they had to [[:wikt:brute force|brute force]] \"skill\", \"action\", and \"character interaction\" paths through each level.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> Playtesting also revealed that their idea of a role-playing game based on the real world was more interesting in theory than in reality,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} as certain aspects of the real world, such as hotels and office buildings, were not compelling in a game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}}  [[File:JFK limousine.png|thumb|The premise of ''Deus Ex'' was inspired by conspiracy theories such as those behind the JFK assassination.]] The game's story changed considerably during production, but the idea of an augmented counterterrorist protagonist named JC Denton remained throughout.<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> Though Spector originally pictured ''Deus Ex'' as akin to ''The X-Files'', lead writer Sheldon Pacotti felt that it ended up more like [[James Bond]].<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> Spector wrote that the team overextended itself by planning highly elaborate scenes.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> Designer Harvey Smith removed a mostly complete White House level due to its complexity and production needs.{{efn|Spector referred to the White House as his \"dream\" level,<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> and their \"toughest map challenge\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} }} Finished [[digital asset]]s were repurposed or abandoned by the team. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as \"the truly deleted scenes of ''Deus Ex''{{'s}} lost levels\".<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/>  One of the things that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, to create a better immersion and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion, so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing come from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor [[Jay Anthony Franke]] to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=GameInformer|title=Replay - Deus Ex|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPHmbulMp4|website=YouTube|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPHmbulMp4|archive-date=2 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deus Ex|title=Let's Play Deus Ex with Warren Spector, Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Norden|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTVBSxnwiCo|website=YouTube|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717111817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTVBSxnwiCo|archive-date=17 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Once coded, the team's game systems did not work as intended.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} The early tests of the conversation system and user interface were flawed.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} The team also found augmentations and skills to be less interesting than they had seemed in the design document.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} In response, Harvey Smith substantially revised the augmentations and skills.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> [[Milestone (project management)|Production milestones]] served as wake-up calls for the game's direction. A May 1998 milestone that called for a functional demo revealed that the size of the game's maps caused [[Frame rate#Video games|frame rate]] issues, which was one of the first signs that maps needed to be cut.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} A year later, the team reached a milestone for finished game systems, which led to better estimates for their future mission work and the reduction of the 500-page design document to 270 pages.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} Spector recalled Smith's mantra on this point: \"less is more\". {{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=54–55}}  One of the team's biggest blind spots was the AI programming for NPCs. Spector wrote that they considered it in preproduction, but that they did not figure out how to handle it until \"relatively late in development\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} This led to wasted time when the team had to discard their old AI code. The team built atop their [[game engine]]'s shooter-based AI instead of writing new code that would allow characters to exhibit convincing emotions. As a result, NPC behavior was variable until the very end of development. Spector felt that the team's \"sin\" was their inconsistent display of a trustable \"human AI\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}  === Technology === [[File:UE Logo Black Centered.svg|180px|thumb|left|''Deus Ex'' used the [[Unreal Engine|Unreal game engine]], which was designed for first-person shooters]] The game was developed on systems including dual-processor [[Pentium Pro]] 200s and [[Athlon]] 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using [[SCSI]]. The team used \"more than 100 video cards\" throughout development.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} ''Deus Ex'' was built using [[Visual Studio]], [[Lightwave]], and [[Lotus Notes]]. They also made a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team used [[UnrealEd]] atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was \"superior to anything else available\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Their trust in [[UnrealScript]] led them to code \"special-cases\" for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was a lesson to always prefer \"general solutions\" over \"special casing\", such that the toolset works predictably.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}  They waited to license a game engine until after preproduction,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} expecting the benefits of licensing to be more time for the content and gameplay, which Spector reported to be the case. They chose the Unreal engine, as it did 80% of what they needed from an engine and was more economical than building from scratch. Their small programming team allowed for a larger design group. The programmers also found the engine accommodating,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} though it took about nine months to acclimate to the software.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector felt that they would have understood the code better had they built it themselves, instead of \"treating the engine as a [[black box]]\" and coding conservatively.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} He acknowledged that this precipitated into the [[Direct3D]] issues in their final release, which slipped through their quality assurance testing.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Spector also noted that the artificial intelligence, pathfinding, and sound propagation were designed for shooters and should have been rewritten from scratch instead of relying on the engine. He thought the licensed engine worked well enough that he expected to use the same for the game's sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' and ''[[Thief 3]]''.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} He added that developers should not attempt to force their technology to perform in ways it was not intended, and should find a balance between perfection and pragmatism.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}  === Music === {{Listen |filename=Deus_Ex_-_Title_Song.ogg |title=Alexander Brandon \"''Deus Ex'' Main Title\" |description=30-second sample from the theme song of ''Deus Ex''. |format=[[Ogg]]}}  The soundtrack of ''Deus Ex'', composed by [[Alexander Brandon]] (primary contributor, including main theme), [[Dan Gardopée]] (\"Naval Base\" and \"Vandenberg\"), [[Michiel van den Bos]] (\"UNATCO\", \"Lebedev's Airfield\", \"Airfield Action\", \"DuClare Chateau\", plus minor contribution to some of Brandon's tracks), and [[Reeves Gabrels]] (\"NYC Bar\"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deusex-machina.com/information/faq-goty.asp |title=Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition FAQ. |work=Deus Ex Machina |access-date=March 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228194835/http://www.deusex-machina.com/information/faq-goty.asp |archive-date=February 28, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> was praised by critics for complementing the gritty atmosphere predominant throughout the game with melodious and [[ambient music]] incorporated from a number of genres, including [[techno]], [[jazz]], and [[classical music|classical]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/deusex/Deus_Ex-2.html |title=Deus Ex review |work=RPGFan |author=Bahamut |access-date=March 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812221912/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/deusex/Deus_Ex-2.html |archive-date=August 12, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33407 |title=Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition review |work=Allgame |last=Allen |first=Christopher |access-date=March 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114141416/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33407 |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womengamers.com/revprev/act/act-deusex.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315043118/http://www.womengamers.com/revprev/act/act-deusex.php |archive-date=2010-03-15 |title=Deus Ex review |work=WomenGamers |author=iceVic |access-date=March 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The music sports a basic dynamic element, similar to the [[iMUSE]] system used in early 1990s [[LucasArts]] games; during play, the music will change to a different iteration of the currently playing song based on the player's actions, such as when the player starts a conversation, engages in combat, or transitions to the next level.

The film was being produced by [[Laura Ziskin]], along with Greg Pruss attached with writing the screenplay. Peter Schlessel, president of the production for Columbia Pictures, and Paul Baldwin, president of marketing for Eidos Interactive, stated that they were confident in that the adaptation would be a successful development for both the studios and the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=COLUMBIA TO MAKE DEUS EX MOVIE|url=http://megagames.com/movies/columbia-make-deus-ex-movie|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102064832/http://megagames.com/movies/columbia-make-deus-ex-movie|archive-date=2013-11-02|access-date=2012-08-25|work=Megagames}}</ref> In March 2003, during an interview with Greg Pruss, he informed IGN that the character of JC Denton would be \"a little bit filthier than he was in the game\".
